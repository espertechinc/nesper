			Event patterns match when an event or multiple events occur that match the pattern's definition. Patterns can also be time-based.
         </para>

        <para>
			Pattern expressions consist of pattern atoms and pattern operators:
         </para>

				<para>
					Pattern <emphasis>atoms</emphasis> are the basic building blocks of patterns. Atoms are filter expressions, observers for time-based events and plug-in custom observers that observe external events not under the control of the engine.

        <para>
			There are 4 types of pattern operators:
         </para>

		<orderedlist spacing="compact">
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Operators that control pattern sub-expression repetition: <literal>every</literal>, <literal>every-distinct</literal>, <literal>[num]</literal> and <literal>until</literal>

				<para>
					Temporal operators that operate on event order: <literal>-&gt;</literal> (followed-by)
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Guards are where-conditions that control the lifecycle of subexpressions. Examples are <literal>timer:within</literal>, <literal>timer:withinmax</literal> and <literal>while</literal>-expression. Custom plug-in guards may also be used.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

        <para>
			Pattern expressions can be nested arbitrarily deep by including the nested expression(s) in <literal>()</literal> round parenthesis.
         </para>

        <para>
			Underlying the pattern matching is a state machine that transitions between states based on arriving events and based on time advancing. A single event or advancing time may 
			cause a reaction in multiple parts of your active pattern state.

			<para>
				This is an example pattern expression that matches on every <literal>ServiceMeasurement</literal> events in which the
				value of the <literal>latency</literal> event property is over 20 seconds, and on every <literal>ServiceMeasurement</literal> event in which the
				<literal>success</literal> property is false. Either one or the other condition must be true for this pattern to match.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every (spike=ServiceMeasurement(latency>20000) or error=ServiceMeasurement(success=false))]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				In the example above, the pattern expression starts with an <literal>every</literal> operator to indicate that the pattern should fire for every matching events and not just the first
				matching event. Within the <literal>every</literal> operator in round brackets is a nested pattern expression using the <literal>or</literal> operator. 
				The left hand of the <literal>or</literal> operator is a filter expression that filters for events with a high latency value. The right hand of the operator 
				contains a filter expression that filters for events with error status. Filter expressions are explained in <xref linkend="pattern-filter"/>.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				The example above assigned the tags <literal>spike</literal> and <literal>error</literal> to the events in the pattern. The tags are important since the
				engine only places tagged events into the output event(s) that a pattern generates, and that the engine supplies to listeners of the pattern statement. The tags can
				further be selected in the select-clause of an EPL statement as discussed in <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-patterns"/>.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Patterns can also contain comments within the pattern as outlined in <xref linkend="epl-syntax-comments"/>.
			</para>

			<para>
				Pattern statements are created via the <literal>EPAdministrator</literal> interface. The <literal>EPAdministrator</literal> interface allows to create pattern statements in two ways:
				Pattern statements that want to make use of the EPL <literal>select</literal> clause or any other EPL constructs use the <literal>CreateEPL</literal> method to create a statement that specifies one or more pattern expressions. EPL statements that use patterns are described in more detail in <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-patterns"/>. Use the syntax as shown in below example.

  "every (spike=" + eventName + "(latency>20000) or error=" + eventName + "(success=false))]");
]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Pattern statements that do not need to make use of the EPL <literal>select</literal> clause or any other EPL constructs can use the <literal>CreatePattern</literal> method, as in below example.
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[EPStatement myTrigger = admin.CreatePattern(
  "every (spike=" + eventName + "(latency>20000) or error=" + eventName + "(success=false))");

				A pattern may appear anywhere in the <literal>from</literal> clause of an EPL statement including joins and subqueries. Patterns may therefore be used in combination with the <literal>where</literal> clause, <literal>group by</literal> clause, <literal>having</literal> clause as well as output rate limiting and <literal>insert into</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				In addition, a data window view can be declared onto a pattern. A data window declared onto a pattern only serves to retain pattern matches. A data window declared onto a pattern does not limit, cancel, remove or delete intermediate pattern matches of the pattern when pattern matches leave the data window.
			</para>

			<para>
				This example statement demonstrates the idea by selecting a total price per customer over pairs of events (ServiceOrder followed by a ProductOrder event for the same customer id within 1 minute), occuring in the last 2 hours, in which the sum of price is greater than 100, and using a <literal>where</literal> clause to filter on name:

			<para>			
				When a pattern fires it publishes one or more events to any event handlers attached to the pattern statement. 
				Event handlers are required to implement the <literal>com.espertech.esper.client.UpdateEventHandler</literal> delegate.
			</para>
			
			<para>            
				The example below shows an implementation of the <literal>com.espertech.esper.client.UpdateEventHandler</literal> delegate.
				We add the anonymous delegate to the <literal>myPattern</literal> statement created earlier. 
				The listener code simply extracts the underlying event class.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[myPattern.Events += 
  delegate(Object sender, UpdateEventArgs e) {
    ServiceMeasurement spike = (ServiceMeasurement) e.NewEvents[0].Get("spike");
    ServiceMeasurement error = (ServiceMeasurement) e.NewEvents[0].Get("error");
    ... // either spike or error can be null, depending on which occurred
    ... // add more logic here
  };
]]></programlisting>

			<para>            
				Event handlers receive the sender of the event (the statement) and an event that indicates details about the event that has occurred.  The event includes an array of <literal>EventBean</literal> instances in the <literal>NewEvents</literal> property.
				There is one <literal>EventBean</literal> instance passed to the event handler for each combination of events that matches
				the pattern expression. At least one <literal>EventBean</literal> instance is always passed to the event handler.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The properties of each <literal>EventBean</literal> instance contain the underlying events that caused the
				pattern to fire, if events have been named in the filter expression via the <literal>name=eventType</literal> syntax.
				The property name is thus the name supplied in the pattern expression, while the property type is the type of the underlying class, 
				in this example <literal>ServiceMeasurement</literal>.

        <sect2 id="pattern-howto-pull-data" >
           <title>Pulling Data from Patterns</title>
           
			<para>
				Data can also be obtained from pattern statements via the <literal>GetSafeEnumerator()</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator()</literal> methods on <literal>EPStatement</literal> (the pull API). 
				If the pattern had fired at least once, then the iterator returns the last event for which it fired.
				The <literal>MoveNext()</literal> method can be used to determine if the pattern had fired.	Additionally, extension methods such as <literal>HasFirst</literal> and <literal>FirstOrDefault</literal> can be applied to the statement because it implements the <literal>IEnumerable</literal> interface.
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[if (myPattern.HasFirst()) {
	ServiceMeasurement event = (ServiceMeasurement) view.FirstOrDefault().Get("alert");
    ... // some more code here to process the event
}
else {
    ... // no matching events at this time
}]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Further, if a data window is defined onto a pattern, the iterator returns the pattern matches according to the data window expiry policy.
			</para>

			<para>
				This pattern specifies a length window of 10 elements that retains the last 10 matches of A and B events, for use via iterator or for use in a join or subquery:

           <title>Pattern Error Reporting</title>
           
			<para>
			  While the pattern compiler analyzes your pattern and verifies its integrity, it may not detect certain pattern errors that may occur at runtime. Sections of this pattern documentation
			  point out common cases where the pattern engine will log a runtime error. We recommend turning on the log warning level at project development time to inspect and report on warnings logged.
			  If a statement name is assigned to a statement then the statement name is logged as well.

        <title>Filter Expressions In Patterns</title>

		<indexterm><primary>pattern</primary><secondary>filter expressions</secondary></indexterm>
		<para>
			The simplest form of filter is a filter for events of a given type without any conditions on the event property values. This filter matches any event of that type regardless of the event's properties. The example below is such a filter. Note that this event pattern would stop firing as soon as the first RfidEvent is encountered.
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[com.mypackage.myevents.RfidEvent]]></programlisting>

		 <para>
			 To make the event pattern fire for every RfidEvent and not just the first event, use the <literal>every</literal> keyword.
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[every com.mypackage.myevents.RfidEvent]]></programlisting>
		 
		 <para>
			 The example above specifies the fully-qualified type name as the event type. Via configuration, the event pattern above can be simplified by using the name
			 that has been defined for the event type.
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[every RfidEvent]]></programlisting>
		 
		 <para>
			 Interfaces and superclasses are also supported as event types. In the below example <literal>IRfidReadable</literal> is an interface class, and the statement matches any event that implements this interface:
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[every org.myorg.rfid.IRfidReadable]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The filtering criteria to filter for events with certain event property values are placed within parenthesis after the event type name:
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[RfidEvent(category="Perishable")]]></programlisting>
		 
		<para>
			All expressions can be used in filters, including static method invocations that return a boolean value:
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[RfidEvent(com.mycompany.MyRFIDLib.isInRange(x, y) or (x<0 and y < 0))]]></programlisting>
			
		<para>
			Filter expressions can be separated via a single comma '<literal>,</literal>'. The comma represents a logical AND between expressions:
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[RfidEvent(zone=1, category=10)
...is equivalent to...
RfidEvent(zone=1 and category=10)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The following set of operators are highly optimized through indexing and are the preferred means of filtering high-volume event streams:

						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							use the <literal>in </literal> keyword and round <literal>()</literal> or square brackets <literal>[]</literal> to control how endpoints are included
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							for inverted ranges use the <literal>not</literal> keyword and the <literal>between</literal> or <literal>in</literal> keywords
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					list-of-values checks using the <literal>in</literal> keyword or the <literal>not in </literal> keywords followed by a comma-separated list of values
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>
			At compile time as well as at run time, the engine scans new filter expressions for subexpressions that can be indexed. Indexing filter values to match event properties of incoming events enables the engine to match incoming events faster. The above list of operators represents the set of operators that the engine can best convert into indexes. The use of comma or logical <literal>and</literal> in filter expressions does not impact optimizations by the engine. 
		</para>
		
		<para>
			For more information on filters please see <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-filter"/>. Contained-event selection on filters in patterns is further described in <xref linkend="epl-containedeventselect"/>.
		</para>

		<para>
			Filter criteria can also refer to events matching prior named events in the same expression. Below pattern is an example in which the pattern
			matches once for every RfidEvent that is preceded by an RfidEvent with the same asset id.
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[every e1=RfidEvent -> e2=RfidEvent(assetId=e1.assetId)]]></programlisting>
		 
		<para>
			The syntax shown above allows filter criteria to reference prior results by specifying the event name tag of the prior event, and the event property name. The tag names in the above example were <literal>e1</literal> and <literal>e2</literal>. This syntax can be used in all filter operators or expressions including ranges and the <literal>in</literal> set-of-values check:
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[every e1=RfidEvent -> 
  e2=RfidEvent(MyLib.isInRadius(e1.x, e1.y, x, y) and zone in (1, e1.zone))]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			An arriving event changes the truth value of all expressions that look for the event. Consider the pattern as follows:
		 </para>
		 <programlisting><![CDATA[every (RfidEvent(zone > 1) and RfidEvent(zone < 10))]]></programlisting>		 
		<para>
			The pattern above is satisfied as soon as only one event with zone in the interval [2, 9] is received.

            <para>				
				The <literal>every</literal> operator indicates that the pattern sub-expression should restart when the subexpression qualified by the <literal>every</literal> keyword evaluates to true or false.
				Without the <literal>every</literal> operator the pattern sub-expression stops when the pattern sub-expression evaluates to true or false.
            </para>
				
            <para>				
				As a side note, please be aware that a single invocation to the <literal>UpdateEventHandler</literal> may deliver multiple events in one invocation, since the <literal>UpdateEventArgs</literal> contain an array of values.
            </para>

            <para>
				Thus the <literal>every</literal> operator works like a factory for the pattern sub-expression contained within. When the pattern sub-expression within it fires and thus quits checking for events, the <literal>every</literal> causes the start of a new pattern sub-expression listening for more occurrences of the same
				event or set of events.
            </para>				

            <para>
				Every time a pattern sub-expression within an <literal>every</literal> operator turns true the engine starts a new active subexpression looking 
				for more event(s) or timing conditions that match the pattern sub-expression. If the <literal>every</literal> operator is not specified for a subexpression, 
				the subexpression stops after the first match was found.
            </para>
            
            <para>
				This pattern fires when encountering an A event and then stops looking.
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[A]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				This pattern keeps firing when encountering A events, and doesn't stop looking.
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every A]]></programlisting>
			
            <para>
				When using <literal>every</literal> operator with the <literal>-></literal> followed-by operator, each time the <literal>every</literal> operator restarts it also starts a new subexpression instance looking for events in the followed-by subexpression.
            </para>				

            <para>
				Let's consider an example event sequence as follows.

            <para>
				The examples show that it is possible that a pattern fires for multiple combinations of events that match a pattern expression.
				Each combination is posted as an <literal>EventBean</literal> instance to the <literal>UpdateEventHandler</literal> implementation.
            </para>
            
            <para>
				Let's consider the <literal>every</literal> operator in conjunction with a subexpression that matches 3 events that follow each other:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every (A -> B -> C)]]></programlisting>
  
            <para>
				The pattern first looks for A events. When an A event arrives, it looks for a B event. After the B event arrives, the pattern looks for a C event. Finally, when the C event arrives the pattern fires. The engine then starts looking for an A event again.
            </para>

            <para>
				Assume that between the B event and the C event a second A<subscript>2</subscript> event arrives. The pattern would ignore the A<subscript>2</subscript> event entirely since it's then looking for a C event.
				As observed in the prior example, the <literal>every</literal> operator restarts the subexpression <literal>A -> B -> C</literal> only when the subexpression fires.
            </para>

            <para>
				In the next statement the <literal>every</literal> operator applies only to the A event, not the whole subexpression:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every A -> B -> C]]></programlisting>
 
            <para>
				This pattern now matches for each A event that is followed by a B event and then a C event, regardless of when the A event arrives. Note that for each A event that arrives the pattern engine starts a new subexpression looking for a B event and then a C event, outputting each combination of matching events.
            </para>
			
			<sect3 id="pattern-every-ending-subexp">
				<title>Limiting Subexpression Lifetime</title>
				
				<para>
					As the introduction of the <literal>every</literal> operator states, the operator starts new subexpression instances and can cause multiple matches to occur for a single arriving event.
				</para>

				<para>
					New subexpressions also take a very small amount of system resources and thereby your application should carefully consider when subexpressions must end when designing patterns. Use the <literal>timer:within</literal> construct and the <literal>and not</literal> constructs to end active subexpressions. The data window onto a pattern stream does not serve to limit pattern sub-expression lifetime.
				</para>

				<para>
					Lets look at a concrete example. Consider the following sequence of events arriving:
				</para>
				<para>
					A<subscript>1</subscript> &nbsp;
					A<subscript>2</subscript> &nbsp;  
					B<subscript>1</subscript> &nbsp;
				</para>

				<para>
					This pattern matches on arrival of B<subscript>1</subscript> and outputs two events (an array of length 2 if using a listener). The two events are the combinations {A<subscript>1</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>} and {A<subscript>2</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>}:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -> b=B]]></programlisting>
				
				<para>
					The <literal>and not</literal> operators are used to end an active subexpression.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The next pattern matches on arrival of B<subscript>1</subscript> and outputs only the last A event which is the combination {A<subscript>2</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>}:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -> (b=B and not A)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The <literal>and not</literal> operators cause the subexpression looking for {A<subscript>1</subscript>, B?} to end when A<subscript>2</subscript> arrives.
				</para>

				<para>
					Similarly, in the pattern below the engine starts a new subexpression looking for a B event every 1 second. After 5 seconds there are 5 subexpressions active looking for a B event and 5 matches occur at once if a B event arrives after 5 seconds.
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every timer:interval(1 sec) -> b=B]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Again the <literal>and not</literal> operators can end subexpressions that are not intended to match any longer:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every timer:interval(1 sec) -> (b=B and not timer:interval(1 sec))
// equivalent to
every timer:interval(1 sec) -> (b=B where timer:within(1 sec))]]></programlisting>
			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="pattern-every-sample1">
				<title><literal>Every</literal> Operator Example</title>

				<para>
					In this example we consider a generic pattern in which the pattern must match for each A event followed by a B event and followed by a C event, in which both the B event and the C event must arrive within 1 hour of the A event. The first approach to the pattern is as follows:
				</para>

				<programlisting><![CDATA[every A  -> (B -> C) where timer:within(1 hour)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Consider the following sequence of events arriving:
				</para>
				<para>
					A<subscript>1</subscript> &nbsp;
					A<subscript>2</subscript> &nbsp;  
					B<subscript>1</subscript> &nbsp;
					C<subscript>1</subscript> &nbsp;  
					B<subscript>2</subscript> &nbsp;
					C<subscript>2</subscript>
				</para>

				<para>
					First, the pattern as above never stops looking for A events since the <literal>every</literal> operator instructs the pattern to keep looking for A events.
				</para>
					
				<para>
					When A<subscript>1</subscript> arrives, the pattern starts a new subexpression that keeps A<subscript>1</subscript> in memory and looks for any B event. At the same time, it also keeps looking for more A events. 
				</para>
					
				<para>
					When A<subscript>2</subscript> arrives, the pattern starts a new subexpression that keeps A<subscript>2</subscript> in memory and looks for any B event. At the same time, it also keeps looking for more A events. 
				</para>
					
				<para>
					After the arrival of A<subscript>2</subscript>, there are 3 subexpressions active:
				</para>

				<orderedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The first active subexpression with A<subscript>1</subscript> in memory, looking for any B event.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The second active subexpression with A<subscript>2</subscript> in memory, looking for any B event.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							A third active subexpression, looking for the next A event.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>

				<para>
					In the pattern above, we have specified a 1-hour lifetime for subexpressions looking for B and C events. Thus, if no B and no C event arrive within 1 hour after A<subscript>1</subscript>, the first subexpression goes away. If no B and no C event arrive within 1 hour after A<subscript>2</subscript>, the second subexpression goes away. The third subexpression however stays around looking for more A events.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The pattern as shown above thus matches on arrival of C<subscript>1</subscript> for combination {A<subscript>1</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>, C<subscript>1</subscript>} and
					for combination {A<subscript>2</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>, C<subscript>1</subscript>}, provided that B<subscript>1</subscript> and C<subscript>1</subscript> arrive within an hour of A<subscript>1</subscript> and A<subscript>2</subscript>.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					You may now ask how to match on {A<subscript>1</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>, C<subscript>1</subscript>} and {A<subscript>2</subscript>, B<subscript>2</subscript>, C<subscript>2</subscript>} instead, since 
					you may need to correlate on a given property.					
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The pattern as discussed above matches every A event followed by the first B event followed by the next C event, and doesn't specifically qualify the B or C events to look for based on the A event.  To look for specific B and C events in relation to a given A event, the correlation must use one or more of the properties of the A event, such as the "id" property:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -> (B(id=a.id -> C(id=a.id)) where timer:within(1 hour)]]></programlisting>
				
				<para>
					The pattern as shown above thus matches on arrival of C<subscript>1</subscript> for combination {A<subscript>1</subscript>, B<subscript>1</subscript>, C<subscript>1</subscript>} and
					on arrival of C<subscript>2</subscript> for combination {A<subscript>2</subscript>, B<subscript>2</subscript>, C<subscript>2</subscript>}.
				</para>

			</sect3>

			<sect3 id="pattern-every-sample2">
				<title>Sensor Example</title>
				<para>
					This example looks at temperature sensor events named Sample. The pattern detects when 3 sensor events indicate a temperature of more then 50 degrees uninterrupted within 90 seconds of the first event, considering events for the same sensor only.
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every sample=Sample(temp > 50) ->
( (Sample(sensor=sample.sensor, temp > 50) and not Sample(sensor=sample.sensor, temp <= 50))   
  ->
  (Sample(sensor=sample.sensor, temp > 50) and not Sample(sensor=sample.sensor, temp <= 50))   
 ) where timer:within(90 seconds))]]></programlisting>
	
				<para>
					The pattern starts a new subexpression in the round braces after the first followed-by operator for each time a sensor indicated more then 50 degrees. Each subexpression then lives a maximum of 90 seconds. Each subexpression ends if a temperature of 50 degress or less is encountered for the same sensor. Only if 3 temperature events in a row indicate more then 50 degrees, and within 90 seconds of the first event, and for the same sensor, does this pattern fire.

			<indexterm><primary><literal>every-distinct</literal> pattern operator</primary></indexterm>
			<indexterm><primary>pattern operator</primary><secondary>every-distinct</secondary></indexterm>

            <para>				
				Similar to the <literal>every</literal> operator in most aspects, the <literal>every-distinct</literal> operator indicates that the pattern sub-expression should restart when the subexpression qualified by the <literal>every-distinct</literal> keyword evaluates to true or false. In addition, the <literal>every-distinct</literal> eliminates duplicate results received from an active subexpression according to its distinct-value expressions.
            </para>

            <para>
				The synopsis for the <literal>every-distinct</literal> pattern operator is:
            </para>
		   <synopsis>every-distinct(<emphasis>distinct_value_expr </emphasis>[, <emphasis>distinct_value_exp</emphasis>[...][, <emphasis>expiry_time_period</emphasis>])</synopsis>

            <para>
				Within parenthesis are one or more <emphasis>distinct_value_expr</emphasis> expressions that return the values by which to remove duplicates.
            </para>

            <para>
				You may optionally specify an <emphasis>expiry_time_period</emphasis> time period. If present, the pattern engine expires and removes distinct key values that are older then the time period, removing their associated memory and allowing such distinct values to match again.
				When your distinct value expressions return an unlimited number of values, for example when your distinct value is a timestamp or auto-increment column, you should always specify an expiry time period.
            </para>

            <para>
				When specifying properties in the distinct-value expression list, you must ensure that the event types providing properties are tagged. Only properties of event types within filter expressions that are sub-expressions to the <literal>every-distinct</literal> may be specified.
            </para>

            <para>
				For example, this pattern keeps firing for every A event with a distinct value for its <literal>aprop</literal> property:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every-distinct(a.aprop) a=A]]></programlisting>
			
            <para>
				Note that the pattern above assigns the <literal>a</literal> tag to the A event and uses <literal>a.prop</literal> to identify the <literal>prop</literal> property as a value of the <literal>a</literal> event  A.
            </para>

            <para>
				A pattern that returns the first Sample event for each sensor, assuming sensor is a field that returns a unique id identifying the sensor that originated the Sample event, is:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every-distinct(s.sensor) s=Sample]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				The next pattern looks for pairs of A and B events and returns only the first pair for each combination of <literal>aprop</literal> of an A event and <literal>bprop</literal> of a B event:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every-distinct(a.aprop, b.bprop) (a=A and b=B)]]></programlisting>
            
            <para>
				The following pattern looks for A events followed by B events for which the value of the <literal>aprop</literal> of an A event is the same value of the <literal>bprop</literal> of a B event but only for each distinct value of <literal>aprop</literal> of an A event:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every-distinct(a.aprop) a=A -> b=B(bprop = a.aprop)]]></programlisting>
  			
            <para>
				When specifying properties as part of distinct-value expressions, properties must be available from tagged event types in sub-expressions to the <literal>every-distinct</literal>.
            </para>

            <para>
				The following patterns are not valid:
            </para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[// Invalid: event type in filter not tagged
every-distinct(aprop) A
			
// Invalid: property not from a sub-expression of every-distinct
a=A -> every-distinct(a.aprop) b=B]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				When an active subexpression to <literal>every-distinct</literal> becomes permanently false, the distinct-values seen from the active subexpression are removed and the sub-expression within is restarted.
            </para>

            <para>
				For example, the below pattern detects each A event distinct by the value of <literal>aprop</literal>.
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every-distinct(a.aprop) (a=A and not B)]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				In the pattern above, when a B event arrives, the subexpression becomes permanently false and is restarted anew, detecting each A event distinct by the value of <literal>aprop</literal> without considering prior values.
            </para>
            
            <para>
              When your distinct key is a timestamp or other non-unique property, specify an expiry time period.
            </para>

            <para>
              The following example returns every distinct A event according to the timestamp property on the A event, retaining each timestamp value for 10 seconds:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every-distinct(a.timestamp, 10 seconds) a=A]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				In the example above, if for a given A event and its timestamp value the same timestamp value occurs again for another A event before 10 seconds passed, the A event is not a match. If 10 seconds passed the pattern indicates a second match.

        <sect2 id="pattern-repeat" >
           <title>Repeat</title>
           
		   <para>
			   The repeat operator fires when a pattern sub-expression evaluates to true a given number of times. The synopsis is as follows:
		   </para>
		   <synopsis>[<emphasis>match_count</emphasis>] <emphasis>repeating_subexpr</emphasis></synopsis>

		   <para>
			   The repeat operator is very similar to the <literal>every</literal> operator in that it restarts the <emphasis>repeating_subexpr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression up to a given number of times.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   <emphasis>match_count</emphasis> is a positive number that specifies how often the <emphasis>repeating_subexpr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression must evaluate to true before the repeat expression itself evaluates to true, after which the engine may indicate a match.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   For example, this pattern fires when the last of five A events arrives:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[[5] A]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   Parenthesis must be used for nested pattern sub-expressions. This pattern fires when the last of a total of any five A or B events arrives:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[[5] (A or B)]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   Without parenthesis the pattern semantics change, according to the operator precedence described earlier. This pattern fires when the last of a total of five A events arrives or a single B event arrives, whichever happens first:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[[5] A or B]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   Tags can be used to name events in filter expression of pattern sub-expressions. The next pattern looks for an A event followed by a B event, and a second A event followed by a second B event. The output event provides indexed and array properties of the same name:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[[2] (a=A -> b=B)]]></programlisting>
			
		   <para>
			   Using tags with repeat is further described in <xref linkend="pattern-repeat-tags"/>.
		   </para>			

		   <para>
			   Consider the following pattern that demonstrates the behavior when a pattern sub-expression becomes permanently false:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[[2] (a=A and not C)]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   In the case where a C event arrives before 2 A events arrive, the pattern above becomes permanently false.
		   </para>
		   
		   <para>
			   Lets add an <literal>every</literal> operator to restart the pattern and thus keep matching for all pairs of A events that arrive without a C event in between each pair:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every [2] (a=A and not C)]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   Since pattern matches return multiple A events, your select clause should use tag <literal>a</literal> as an array, for example:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select a[0].id, a[1].id from pattern [every [2] (a=A and not C)]]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>
			
		<sect2 id="pattern-repeatuntil" >
		   <title>Repeat-Until</title>
		   <para>
			   The repeat <literal>until</literal> operator provides additional control over repeated matching.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   The repeat until operator takes an optional range, a pattern sub-expression to repeat, the <literal>until</literal> keyword and a second pattern sub-expression that ends the repetition. The synopsis is as follows:
		   </para>
		   <synopsis>[<emphasis>range</emphasis>] <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> until <emphasis>end_pattern_expr</emphasis></synopsis>

			<para>
				Without a <emphasis>range</emphasis>, the engine matches the <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression until the <emphasis>end_pattern_expr</emphasis> evaluates to true, at which time the expression turns true.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				An optional <emphasis>range</emphasis> can be used to indicate the minimum number of times that the <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression must become true.
			</para>

			<para>
				The optional <emphasis>range</emphasis> can also specify a maximum number of times that <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression evaluates to true and retains tagged events. When this number is reached, the engine stops the <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression.

			   <programlisting>A until B</programlisting>

			   <para>
				   Nested pattern sub-expressions must be placed in parenthesis since the <literal>until</literal> operator has precedence over most operators. This example collects all A or B events for 10 seconds and places events received in indexed properties 'a' and 'b':

				   The synopsis for the optional <emphasis>range</emphasis> qualifier is:
			   </para>
			   <synopsis>[ [<emphasis>low_endpoint</emphasis>] : [<emphasis>high_endpoint</emphasis>] ]</synopsis>

			   <para>
				   <emphasis>low_endpoint</emphasis> is an optional number that appears on the left of a colon (:), after which follows an optional <emphasis>high_endpoint</emphasis> number.
			   </para>

			   <para>
				   A range thus consists of a <emphasis>low_endpoint</emphasis> and a <emphasis>high_endpoint</emphasis> in square brackets and separated by a colon (:) characters. Both endpoint values are optional but either one or both must be supplied. The <emphasis>low_endpoint</emphasis> can be omitted to denote a range that starts at zero. The <emphasis>high_endpoint</emphasis> can be omitted to denote an open-ended range.
			   </para>

			   <para>
				   Some examples for valid ranges might be:
			   </para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[[3 : 10]
[:3]    // range starts at zero
[2:]    // open-ended range]]></programlisting>

			   <para>
				   The <emphasis>low_endpoint</emphasis>, if specified, defines the minimum number of times that the <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression must become true in order for the expression to become true.
			   </para>

			   <para>
				   The <emphasis>high_endpoint</emphasis>, if specified, is the maximum number of times that the <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression becomes true. If the number is reached, the engine stops the <emphasis>repeated_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression.
			   </para>

			   <para>
				   In all cases, only at the time that the <emphasis>end_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression evaluates to true does the expression become true. If <emphasis>end_pattern_expr</emphasis> pattern sub-expression evaluates to false, then the expression evaluates to false.

			   </para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[[3:] A until B]]></programlisting>

				   A high-endpoint range specifies only a high endpoint and not a low endpoint.
			   </para>

			   <para>
				   In this sample pattern the engine will be looking for a maximum of 3 A events. The expression turns true as soon as a single B event arrives regardless of the number of A events received:
			   </para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[[:3] A until B]]></programlisting>

			   </para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[[:3] (a=A or b=B) until (c=C or d=D)]]></programlisting>
	
			   <para>
				   In the pattern above, if more then 3 A or B events arrive, the pattern stops looking for additional A or B events. The 'a' and 'b' tags retain only the first 3 (combined) matches among A and B events. The output event contains these tagged events as indexed properties.

			   <title>Tags and the Repeat Operator</title>

			   <para>
				   The tags assigned to events in filter subexpressions within a repeat operator are available for use in filter expressions and also in any EPL clause.
			   </para>

			   <para>
					This sample pattern matches 2 A events followed by a B event. Note the filter on B events: only a B event that has a value for the "beta" property that equals any of the "id" property values of the two A events is considered:
			   </para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[[2] A -> B(beta in (a[0].id, a[1].id))]]></programlisting>

			   <para>
					The next EPL statement returns pairs of A events:
			   </para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select a, a[0], a[0].id, a[1], a[1].id
from pattern [ every [2] a=A ] ]]></programlisting>

			   <para>
					The <literal>select</literal> clause of the statement above showcases different ways of accessing tagged events:
			   </para>
			   
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The tag itself can be used to select an array of underlying events. For example, the 'a' expression above returns an array of underlying events of event type A.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The tag as an indexed property returns the underlying event at that index. For instance, the 'a[0]' expression returns the first underlying A event, or null if no such A event was matched by the repeat operator.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The tag as a nested, indexed property returns a property of the underlying event at that index. For example, the 'a[1].id' expression returns the 'id' property value of the second A event, or null if no such second A event was matched by the repeat operator.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</sect3>		   
			  
		   <para>
				You may not use indexed tags defined in the sub-expression to the repeat operator in the same subexpression. For example, in the following pattern the subexpression to the repeat operator is <literal>(a=A() -> b=B(id=a[0].id))</literal> and the tag <literal>a</literal>  cannot be used in its indexed form in the filter for event B:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// invalid
every [2] (a=A() -> b=B(id=a[0].id))]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				Similar to the C# &amp;&amp; operator the <literal>and</literal> operator requires both nested pattern expressions to turn 
				true before the whole expression turns true (a join pattern).
            </para>
            
            <para>
				This pattern matches when both an A event and a B event arrive, at the time the last of the two events arrive:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[A and B]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				This pattern matches on any sequence of an A event followed by a B event and then a C event followed by a D event, or a C event followed by a D and an A event followed by a B event:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[(A -> B) and (C -> D)]]></programlisting>
            
            <para>
				Note that in an <literal>and</literal> pattern expression it is not possible to correlate events based on event property values. For example, this is an invalid pattern:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// This is NOT valid
a=A and B(id = a.id)]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				The above expression is invalid as it relies on the order of arrival of events, however in an <literal>and</literal> expression the order of events is not specified and events fulfill an <literal>and</literal> condition in any order. The above expression can be changed to use the followed-by operator: 
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// This is valid
a=A -> B(id = a.id)
// another example using 'and'...
a=A -> (B(id = a.id) and C(id = a.id))]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				Consider a pattern that looks for the same event:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[A and A]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				The pattern above fires when a single A event arrives. The first arriving A event triggers a state transition in both the left and the right hand side expression.
            </para>
            
            <para>
				In order to match after two A events arrive in any order, there are two options to express this pattern. The followed-by operator is one option and the repeat operator is the second option, as the next two patterns show:
            </para>

            <para>
				The <literal>not</literal> operator negates the truth value of an expression. Pattern expressions prefixed with <literal>not</literal> are automatically 
				defaulted to true upon start, and turn permanently false when the expression within turns true.
            </para>
            
            <para>
				The <literal>not</literal> operator is generally used in conjunction with the <literal>and</literal> operator or subexpressions as the below examples show.
            </para>

           <para>
				This pattern matches only when an A event is encountered followed by a B event but only if no C event was encountered before either an A event and a B event, counting from the time the pattern is started:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[(A -> B) and not C]]></programlisting>
			            
            <para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[A -> (D and not (B or C))]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				It may help your understanding to discuss a pattern that uses the <literal>or</literal> operator and the <literal>not</literal> operator together:				
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[a=A -> (b=B or not C)]]></programlisting>

            <para>
				In the pattern above, when an A event arrives then the engine starts the subexpression <literal>B or not C</literal>. As soon as the subexpression starts, the <literal>not</literal> operator turns to true. The <literal>or</literal> expression turns true and thus your listener receives an invocation providing the A event in the property 'a'. The subexpression does not end and continues listening for B and C events. Upon arrival of a B event your listener receives a second invocation. If instead a C event arrives, the <literal>not</literal> turns permanently false however that does not affect the <literal>or</literal> operator (but would end an <literal>and</literal> operator).
            </para>
            
            <para>
				To test for absence of an event, use <literal>timer:interval</literal> together with <literal>and not</literal> operators. The sample statement reports each 10-second interval during which no A event occurred:
            </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every (timer:interval(10 sec) and not A)]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				In many cases the <literal>not</literal> operator, when used alone, does not make sense. The following example is invalid and will log a warning when the engine is started:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// not a sensible pattern
(not a=A) -> B(id=a.id)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The followed-by <literal>-&gt;</literal> operator can optionally be provided with an expression that limits the number of sub-expression instances of the right-hand side pattern sub-expression. 
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The synopsis for the followed-by operator with limiting expression is:
				</para>
				<synopsis><emphasis>lhs_expression</emphasis> -[<emphasis>limit_expression</emphasis>]> <emphasis>rhs_expression</emphasis></synopsis>
				
				<para>
					Each time the <emphasis>lhs_expression</emphasis> pattern sub-expression turns true the pattern engine starts a new <emphasis>rhs_expression</emphasis> pattern sub-expression.
					The <emphasis>limit_expression</emphasis> returns an integer value that defines a maximum number of pattern sub-expression instances that can simultaneously be present for the same <emphasis>rhs_expression</emphasis>.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					When the limit is reached the pattern engine issues a notification to any condition handlers registered with the engine as described in <xref linkend="api-condition"/> and does not start a new pattern sub-expression instance for the right-hand side pattern sub-expression.
				</para>
								
				<para>
					For example, consider the following pattern which returns for every A event the first B event that matches the <literal>id</literal> field value of the A event:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -> b=B(id = a.id)]]></programlisting>
	
				<para>
					In the above pattern, every time an A event arrives (lhs) the pattern engine starts a new pattern sub-expression (rhs) consisting of a filter for the first B event that has the same value for the <literal>id</literal> field as the A event.
				</para>

				<para>
					In some cases your application may want to limit the number of right-hand side sub-expressions because of memory concerns or to reduce output. You may add a limit expression returning an integer value 
					as part of the operator.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					This example employs the followed-by operator with a limit expression to indicate that maximally 2 filters for B events (the right-hand side pattern sub-expression) may be active at the same time:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -[2]> b=B(id = a.id)]]></programlisting>
				
				<para>
					Note that the limit expression in the example above is not a limit per value of <literal>id</literal> field, but a limit counting all right-hand side pattern sub-expression instances that are managed by that followed-by sub-expression instance.					
				</para>

				<para>
					If your followed-by operator lists multiple sub-expressions with limits, each limit applies to the immediate right-hand side. For example, the pattern below limits the number of filters for B events to 2 and the number of filters for C events to 3:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -[2]> b=B(id = a.id) -[3]> c=C(id = a.id)]]></programlisting>

			<title>Pattern Guards</title>        
	
			<indexterm><primary>pattern guard</primary></indexterm>
			<para>
				Guards are where-conditions that control the lifecycle of subexpressions. Custom guard functions can also be used. The section <xref linkend="extension"/> outlines guard plug-in development in greater detail.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The pattern guard where-condition has no relationship to the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause that filters sets of events.
			</para>

			<para>
				Take as an example the following pattern expression:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[MyEvent where timer.within(10 sec)]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				In this pattern the <literal>timer:within</literal> guard controls the subexpression that is looking for MyEvent events. The guard terminates the subexpression looking for MyEvent events after 10 seconds after start of the pattern. Thus the pattern alerts only once when the first MyEvent event arrives within 10 seconds after start of the pattern.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The <literal>every</literal> keyword requires additional discussion since it also controls subexpression lifecycle. Let's add the <literal>every</literal> keyword to the example pattern:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every MyEvent where timer.within(10 sec)]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				The difference to the pattern without <literal>every</literal> is that each MyEvent event that arrives now starts a new subexpression, including a new guard, looking for a further MyEvent event. The result is that, when a MyEvent arrives within 10 seconds after pattern start, the pattern execution will look for the next MyEvent event to arrive within 10 seconds after the previous one.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				By placing parentheses around the <literal>every</literal> keyword and its subexpression, we can have the <literal>every</literal> under the control of the guard:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[(every MyEvent) where timer.within(10 sec)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In the pattern above, the guard terminates the subexpression looking for all MyEvent events after 10 seconds after start of the pattern. This pattern alerts for all MyEvent events arriving within 10 seconds after pattern start, and then stops.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				Guards do not change the truth value of the subexpression of which the guard controls the lifecycle, and therefore do not cause a restart of the subexpression when used with the <literal>every</literal> operator. For example, the next pattern stops returning matches after 10 seconds unless a match occurred within 10 seconds after pattern start:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every ( (A and B) where timer.within(10 sec) )]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The <literal>while</literal> guard is followed by an expression that the engine evaluates for every match reported by the guard pattern sub-expression. When the expression returns false the pattern sub-expression ends.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The synopsis for <literal>while</literal> is as follows:
				</para>
				<synopsis>while (<emphasis>guard_expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>
				
				<para>
					The <emphasis>guard_expression</emphasis> is any expression that returns a boolean true or false. The expression may contain references to properties of prior events in the same pattern as well as variables and substitution parameters.
				</para>

				<para>
					Each time the subexpression indicates a match, the engine evaluates <emphasis>guard_expression</emphasis> and if true, passes the match and when false, ends the subexpression.
				</para>

				<para>
					This pattern fires for every A event until an A event arrives that has a value of zero or less for its <literal>size</literal> property (assuming A events have an integer <literal>size</literal> property).
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[(every a=A) while (a.size > 0)]]></programlisting>

					The <literal>timer:within</literal> and <literal>timer:withinmax</literal> guards may be parameterized by an expression that contains one or more references to properties of prior events in the same pattern.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					As a simple example, this pattern matches every A event followed by a B event that arrives within <literal>delta</literal> seconds after the A event: 
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=A -> b=B where timer:within (a.delta seconds)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Herein A event is assumed to have a <literal>delta</literal> property that provides the number of seconds to wait for B events. Each arriving A event may have a different value for <literal>delta</literal>
					and the guard is therefore parameterized dynamically based on the prior A event received.
				</para>

				<para>
					When multiple events accumulate, for example when using the match-until or repeat pattern elements, an index must be provided:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[[2] a=A -> b=B where timer:within (a[0].delta + a[1].delta)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The above pattern matches after 2 A events arrive followed by a B event within a time interval after the A event that is defined by the sum of the <literal>delta</literal> properties of both A events.

				<para>
					The <literal>timer:at</literal> observer is similar in function to the Unix “crontab” command. At a specified time the 
					expression turns true. The <literal>at</literal> operator can also be made to pattern match at regular intervals by using an <literal>every</literal> operator 
					in front of the <literal>timer:at</literal> operator. 
				</para>
					
				<para>
					The syntax is: <literal>timer:at (minutes, hours, days of month, months, days of week [, seconds]).</literal>
				</para>
					
				<para>
					The value for seconds is optional. Each element allows wildcard <literal>*</literal> values. Ranges can be specified 
					by means of lower bounds then a colon ‘:’ then the upper bound. The division operator <literal>*/x</literal> can be used to 
					specify that every x<subscript>th</subscript> value is valid. Combinations of these operators can be used by placing these into square brackets([]).
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The <literal>timer:at</literal> observer may also be parameterized by an expression that contains one or more references to properties of prior events in the same pattern, or may also reference variables, substitution parameters or any other expression returning a numeric value. The frequency division operator <literal>*/x</literal> and parameters lists within brackets([]) are an exception: they may only contain variables, substitution parameters or numeric values.

				<para>
					The keyword <literal>last</literal> used in the days-of-month field means the last day of the month (current month). To specify the last day of another month, a value for the month field has to be provided. For example: <literal>timer:at(*, *, last,2,*)</literal> is the last day of February. 
				</para>
					
				<para>
					The <literal>last</literal> keyword in the day-of-week field by itself simply means Saturday. If used in the day-of-week field after another value, it means "the last xxx day of the month" - for example "5 last" means "the last friday of the month". 
					So the last Friday of the current month will be: <literal>timer:at(*, *, *, *, 5 last)</literal>. And the last Friday of June: <literal>timer:at(*, *, *, 6, 5 last)</literal>.
				</para>
	
				<para>
					The keyword <literal>weekday</literal> is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. Variant could include month like in: <literal>timer:at(*, *, 30 weekday, 9, *)</literal> which is Friday September 28th (no jump over month).
				</para>
	
				<para>
					The keyword <literal>lastweekday</literal> is a combination of two parameters, the <literal>last</literal> and the <literal>weekday</literal> keywords. A typical example could be: <literal>timer:at(*, *, *, lastweekday, 9, *)</literal> which will define Friday September 28th (example year is 2007).
				</para>
				
				<sect4 id="pattern-timer-at-every" >
				   <title>timer:at and the <literal>every</literal> Operator</title>
	
					<para>
						When using <literal>timer:at</literal> with the <literal>every</literal> operator the crontab-like timer computes the next time at which the timer should fire based on the specification and the current time. When using <literal>every</literal>, the current time is the time the timer fired or the statement start time if the timer has not fired once.
					</para>

					<para>
						For example, this pattern fires every 1 minute starting at 1:00pm and ending at 1:59pm, every day:
					</para>
					<programlisting><![CDATA[every timer:at(*, 13, *, *, *)]]></programlisting>

					<para>
						Assume the above statement gets started at 1:05pm and 20 seconds. In such case the above pattern fires every 1 minute starting at 1:06pm and ending at 1:59pm for that day and 1:00pm to 1:59pm every following day.
					</para>

					<para>
						To get the pattern to fire only once at 1pm every day, explicitly specify the minute to start. The pattern below fires every day at 1:00pm:
					</para>
					<programlisting><![CDATA[every timer:at(0, 13, *, *, *)]]></programlisting>

					<para>
						By specifying a second resolution the timer can be made to fire every second, for instance:
					</para>
					<programlisting><![CDATA[every timer:at(*, *, *, *, *, *)]]></programlisting>
