    <para>
        Esper has been highly optimized to handle very high throughput streams with very little latency between event receipt and output result posting.
        It is also possible to use Esper on a soft-real-time or hard-real-time JVM to maximize predictability even
        further.

        This section describes performance best practices and explains how to assess Esper performance by using our

            <programlisting>Esper exceeds over 500 000 event/s on a dual CPU 2GHz Intel based hardware,
with engine latency below 3 microseconds average (below 10us with more than 
99% predictability) on a VWAP benchmark with 1000 statements registered in the system 
- this tops at 70 Mbit/s at 85% CPU usage.

Esper also demonstrates linear scalability from 100 000 to 500 000 event/s on this 
hardware, with consistent results accross different statements.

Other tests demonstrate equivalent performance results
(straight through processing, match all, match none, no statement registered,
VWAP with time based window or length based windows).
                
Tests on a laptop demonstrated about 5x time less performance - that is 
between 70 000 event/s and 200 000 event/s - which still gives room for easy 
testing on small configuration.</programlisting>

			<title>Understand how to tune your application</title>
	
			<para>
				Esper runs within application domains for a CLR instance.  Some performance tuning techniques are general purpose for tuning CLR performance, however there have been specific accomodations made to improve Esper performance.
				Statements with time-based or length-based data windows can consume large amounts of memory as their size or length can be large.
			</para>

			<para>
				For time-based data windows, one needs to be aware that the memory consumed depends on the actual event stream input
				throughput. Event pattern instances also consume memory, especially when using the "every"
				keyword in patterns to repeat pattern sub-expressions - which again will depend on the actual event stream input throughput.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Esper makes great use of thread-local data.  This technique ensures that the application can interoperate on two threads independently without the need for a lock.  Esper (CLR) provides specific techniques for selecting the thread-local implementation.  The default CLR ships with thread local storage (TLS) as part of the core model and Esper leverages that through the SystemThreadLocalFactory.  However, performance tests revealed that it's performance was less than optimal and a custom implementation was written for Esper.  This implementation FastThreadLocalFactory is significantly faster than the TLS implementation.  FastThreadLocal is the default implementation for Esper, but may be overridden through configuration.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Esper makes use of locks where necessary to ensure that threads do not collide when using critical resources.  Two types of locks are utilized, standard exclusion locks and reader-writer locks.  Through configuration, implementors can choose the specific type of lock that should be utilized.  When choosing locks, please ensure that are choosing the right locks.  If applications have a significant number of hooks that hold locks open for extended periods of time (Esper by default will not do this), then you should use a standard monitor.  However, if your locks are very tight (default), then you will want to ensure that you are using the spin lock (exclusion) or slim lock (reader-writer).
			</para>
			
		</sect2>
	
		<sect2 id="perf-tips-2">
			<title>Compare Esper to other solutions</title>
			<para>
				If you compare Esper performance to the performance of another solution, you need to ensure that your statements have
				truly equivalent semantics. The is because between different vendors the event processing language can be seem fairly similar 
				whoever may, for all similarities, produce different results.
			</para>

			<para>
				For example some vendor solution mandates the use of "bounded streams". The next statement shows one vendor's event processing syntax:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[// Other (name omitted) vendor solution statement:
select * from (select * from Market where ticker = 'GOOG') retain 1 event
// The above is NOT an Esper statement]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				The semantically equivalent statement in Esper is:
			</para>
		
<programlisting><![CDATA[// Esper statement with the same semantics:
select * from MarketData(ticker='$').std:lastevent()
// ... or ...
select * from MarketData(ticker='$').win:length(1)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				As an example, a NOT semantically equivalent statement in Esper is:
			</para>
		
<programlisting><![CDATA[// Esper statement that DOES ***NOT*** HAVE the same semantics 
// No length window was used
select * from MarketData(ticker='$')]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-3">
			<title>Input and Output Bottlenecks</title>
			<para>
				Your application receives output events from Esper statements through the <literal>UpdateEventHandler</literal> or via the strongly-typed subscriber object. Such output events are delivered by the application or timer thread(s) that sends an input event into the engine instance.
			</para>
			<para>
				The processing of output events that your listener or subscriber performs temporarily blocks the thread until the processing completes, and may thus reduce throughput. It can therefore be beneficial for your application to process output events asynchronously and not block the Esper engine while an output event is being processed by your listener, especially if your listener code performs blocking IO operations.
			</para>
			<para>
				For example, your application may want to send output events to a JMS destination or write output event data to a relational database. For optimal throughput, consider performing such blocking operations in a separate thread.
			</para>
			<para>
				Additionally, when reading input events from a store or network in a performance test, you may find that Esper processes events faster then you are able to feed events into Esper. In such case you may want to consider an in-memory driver for use in performance testing. Also consider decoupling your read operation from the event processing operation (sendEvent method) by having multiple readers or by pre-fetching your data from the store.
			</para>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-3-a">
			<title>Advanced Theading</title>
			<para>
				Esper provides the configuration option to use engine-level queues and threadpools for inbound, outbound and internal executions. See <xref linkend="api-threading-advanced"/> for more information.
			</para>
			<para>
				We recommend the inbound threading if your application does not already employ threading.
			</para>
			<para>
				We recommend the outbound threading if your listeners are blocking. For outbound threading also see the section below on tuning and disabling listener delivery guarantees.
			</para>
			<para>
				If enabling advanced threading options keep in mind that the engine will maintain a queue and thread pool. There is additional overhead associated with entering work units into the queue, maintaining the queue and the hand-off between threads. It is not necessarily true that
				your application will perform better with any of the advanced threading options. 
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-4">
			<title>Select the underlying event rather than individual fields</title>
			
			<para>
				By selecting the underlying event in the select-clause we can reduce load on the engine, since the 
				engine does not need to generate a new output event for each input event.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				For example, the following statement returns the underlying event to update listeners:
			</para>
	
<programlisting><![CDATA[// Better performance
select * from RFIDEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In comparison, the next statement selects individual properties. This statement requires the engine to generate an output event that 
				contains exactly the required properties:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[// Less good performance
select assetId, zone, xlocation, ylocation from RFIDEvent ]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>
		
		<sect2 id="perf-tips-5">
			<title>Prefer stream-level filtering over post-data-window filtering</title>

			<para>
				Esper stream-level filtering is very well optimized, while filtering via the where-clause post any data windows is not optimized. 
				In very simple statements that don't have data windows this distinction can make a performance difference.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				Consider the example below, which performs stream-level filtering:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[// Better performance : stream-level filtering
select * from MarketData(ticker = 'GOOG')]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The example below is the equivalent (same semantics) statement and performs post-data-window filtering without a data window.
				The engine does not optimize statements that filter in the where-clause for the reason that data window views are generally present.
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[// Less good performance : post-data-window filtering
select * from Market where ticker = 'GOOG']]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Thus this optimization technique applies to statements without any data window. 
			</para>

			<para>
				When a data window is used, the semantics change. Let's look at an example to better understand the difference:
				In the next statement only GOOG market events enter the length window:
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select avg(price) from MarketData(ticker = 'GOOG').win:length(100)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The above statement computes the average price of GOOG market data events for the last 100 GOOG market data events. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Compare the filter position to a filter in the where clause. 
				The following statement is NOT equivalent as all events enter the data window (not just GOOG events):
			</para>
	
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select avg(price) from Market.win:length(100) where ticker = 'GOOG']]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The statement above computes the average price of all market data events for the last 100 market data events, and outputs results only for GOOG.
			</para>
		</sect2>
	
		<sect2 id="perf-tips-6">
			<title>Reduce the use of arithmetic in expressions</title>

			<para>
				Esper does not yet attempt to pre-evaluate arithmetic expressions that produce constant results.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				Therefore, a filter expression as below is optimized:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[// Better performance : no arithmetic
select * from MarketData(price>40) ]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				While the engine cannot currently optimize this expression:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[// Less good performance : with arithmetic
select * from MarketData(price+10>50) ]]></programlisting>

		</sect2>
		
		<sect2 id="perf-tips-6a">
			<title>Remove Unneccessary Constructs</title>

			<para>
				If your statement uses <literal>order by</literal> to order output events, consider removing <literal>order by</literal> unless your application does indeed require the events it receives to be ordered.
			</para>

			<para>
				If your statement specifies <literal>group by</literal> but does not use aggregation functions, consider removing <literal>group by</literal>.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-6b">
			<title>End Pattern Sub-Expressions</title>

			<para>
				In patterns, the <literal>every</literal> keyword in conjunction with followed by (<literal>-></literal>) starts a new sub-expression per match. 				
			</para>
			<para>
				For example, the following pattern starts a sub-expression looking for a B event for every A event that arrives.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every A -> B]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Determine under what conditions a subexpression should end so the engine can stop looking for a B event. Here are a few generic examples:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[every A -> (B and not C)
every A -> B where timer:within(1 sec)]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-7">
			<title>Consider using EventPropertyGetter for fast access to event properties</title>

			<para>
				The EventPropertyGetter interface is useful for obtaining an event property value without property name table lookup 
				given an EventBean instance that is of the same event type that the property getter was obtained from.
			</para>

			<para>
				When compiling a statement, the EPStatement instance lets us know the EventType via the getEventType() method.
				From the EventType we can obtain EventPropertyGetter instances for named event properties.
			</para>

			<para>
				To demonstrate, consider the following simple statement:
			</para>
	
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, avg(price) from Market group by symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				After compiling the statement, obtain the EventType.  The event handler can use the type to obtain fast 
				getters for property values of events for the same type:
			</para>
	
<programlisting><![CDATA[var stmt = epService.EPAdministrator.CreateEPL(stmtText);
var stmtEventType = stmt.EventType;
var symbolGetter = stmtEventType.GetGetter("symbol");
var avgPriceGetter = stmtEventType.GetGetter("avg(price)");
var eventHandler = delegate(Object sender, UpdateEventArgs e) {
	var symbol = (String) symbolGetter.get(e.NewEvents[0]);
	var volume = (long) volumeGetter.get(e.NewEvents[0]);
	// some more logic here
};

stmt.Events += eventHandler;]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>
			
		<sect2 id="perf-tips-8">
			<title>Consider casting the underlying event</title>

			<para>
				When an application requires the value of most or all event properties, it can often be best to simply select the underlying event via wildcard
				and cast the received events.
			</para>

			<para>
				Let's look at the sample statement:
			</para>
	
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MarketData(symbol regexp 'E[a-z]')]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				An update listener to the statement may want to cast the received events to the expected underlying event class:
			</para>
	
<programlisting><![CDATA[    public void HandleEvents(Object sender, UpdateEventArgs e) {
        MarketData md = (MarketData) e.NewEvents[0].Underlying;
        // some more logic here
    }]]></programlisting>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-9">
			<title>Turn off logging</title>

			<para>
	Since Esper 1.10, even if you don't have a log4j configuration file in place, Esper will make sure to minimize execution path logging overhead.
	For prior versions, and to reduce logging overhead overall, we recommend the "WARN" log level or the "INFO" log level.
			</para>

			<para>
	Please see the log4j configuration file in "etc/infoonly_log4j.xml" for example log4j settings.

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-10">
			<title>Disable view sharing</title>

			<para>
				By default, Esper compares streams and views in use with existing statement's streams and views, and then reuses views to efficiently share resources between statements. The benefit is reduced resources usage, however the potential cost is that in multithreaded applications a shared view may mean excessive locking of multiple processing threads.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				Consider disabling view sharing for better threading performance if your application overall uses fewer statements and statements have very similar streams, filters and views. 
			</para>

			<para>
				View sharing can be disabled via XML configuration or API, and the next code snippet shows how, using the API:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.EngineDefaults.ViewResources.IsShareViews = false;]]></programlisting>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-11">
			<title>Tune or disable delivery order guarantees</title>

			<para>
				If your application is not a multithreaded application, or you application is not sensitive to the order of delivery of result events to your application listeners, then consider disabling the delivery order guarantees the engine makes towards ordered delivery of results to listeners:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.EngineDefaults.Threading.IsListenerDispatchPreserveOrder = false;]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				If your application is not a multithreaded application, or your application uses the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to make results of one statement available for further consuming statements but does not require ordered delivery of results from producing statements to consuming statements, you may disable delivery order guarantees between statements: 
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.EngineDefaults.Threading.IsInsertIntoDispatchPreserveOrder = false;]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Additional configuration options are available and described in the configuration section that specify timeout values and spin or thread context switching.
			</para>

			<para>
				Esper logging will log the following informational message when guaranteed delivery order to listeners is enabled and spin lock times exceed the default or configured timeout : <literal>Spin wait timeout exceeded in listener dispatch</literal>.
				The respective message for delivery from <literal>insert into</literal> statements to consuming statements is <literal>Spin wait timeout exceeded in insert-into dispatch</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				If your application sees messages that spin lock times are exceeded, your application has several options: First, disabling preserve order is an option. Second, ensure your listener does not perform (long-running) blocking operations before returning, for example by performing output event processing in a separate thread. Third, change the timeout value to a larger number to block longer without logging the message.
			</para>
		</sect2>
		
		<sect2 id="perf-tips-12">
			<title>Use a Subscriber Object to Receive Events</title>

			<para>
				The subscriber object is a technique to receive result data that has performance advantages over the <literal>UpdateEventHandler</literal> interface. Please refer to <xref linkend="api-admin-subscriber"/>.
			</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-13">
			<title>High-Arrival-Rate Streams and Single Statements</title>

			<para>
				A statement is associated with certain statement state that consists of current aggregation values, partial pattern matches, data windows or other view state depending on whether your statement uses such constructs. When an engine receives events it updates statement state under locking such that statement state remains consistent under concurrent multi-threaded access.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				For high-volume streams, the locking required to protected statement state may slow down or introduce blocking for very high arrival rates of events that apply to the very same statement and its state. You may want to consider splitting a single statement into multiple statements that each look for a certain subset of the high-arrival-rate stream. There is very little cost in terms of memory or CPU resources per statement, the engine can handle larger number of statements usually as efficiently as single statements.
			</para>

			<para>
				For example, consider the following statement:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// less effective in a highly threaded environment 
select venue, ccyPair, side, sum(qty)
from CumulativePrice.std:groupwin(ccyPair,side) as w
where w.side='O']]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The engine will protect state of a statements by a lock on the statement level, as discussed in the API section. In highly threaded applications threads may block on the single statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				Consider creating a statement per currency instead, for example:			
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select venue, ccyPair, side, sum(qty) from CumulativePrice(side='O', ccyPair='USD')
select venue, ccyPair, side, sum(qty) from CumulativePrice(side='O', ccyPair='EURO')]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="perf-tips-13a">
			<title>Joins And Where-clause And Data Windows</title>

			<para>
				When joining streams the engine builds a product of the joined data windows based on the <literal>where</literal> clause. It analyzes the <literal>where</literal> clause at time of statement compilation and
				builds the appropriate indexes and query strategy. Avoid using expressions in the join <literal>where</literal> clause that require evaluation, such as user-defined functions or arithmatic expressions.
			</para>

			<para>
				When joining streams and not providing a <literal>where</literal> clause, consider using the <literal>std:lastevent</literal> data window to join only the last event of each stream. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample query below can produce up to 5,000 rows when both data windows are filled and an event arrives for either stream:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[// Avoid joins between streams with data windows without where-clause
select * from StreamA.win:length(100), StreamB.win:length(50)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Consider using a subquery, consider using separate statements with insert-into and consider providing a <literal>where</literal> clause to limit the product of rows.
			</para>

			<title>Patterns and Pattern Sub-Expression Instances</title>

			<para>
				The <literal>every</literal> and repeat operators in patterns control the number of sub-expressions that are active. Each sub-expression can consume memory as it may retain, depending on the use of tags in the pattern,
				the matching events. A large number of active sub-expressions can reduce performance or lead to out-of-memory errors. 
			</para>

			<para>
				During the design of the pattern statement consider the use of <literal>timer:within</literal> to reduce the amount of time a sub-expression lives, or consider the <literal>not</literal> operator to end a sub-expression.

			</para>

			<para>
				In the following sample pattern the engine starts, for each arriving AEvent, a new pattern sub-expression looking for a matching BEvent. Since the AEvent is tagged with <literal>a</literal> the engine retains
				each AEvent until a match is found for delivery to listeners or subscribers:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[every a=AEvent -> b=BEvent(b.id = a.id)]]></programlisting>

				A larger number of threads would benefit of more CPU and cores. If you have very low latency requirements, you should consider
				getting more GHz per core, and possibly soft real-time JVM to enforce GC determinism at the JVM level, or even consider dedicated hardware such as Azul.
				If your statements utilize large data windows, more RAM and heap space will be utilized hence you should clearly plan and account for that and possibly consider 64bit architectures or consider
				<ulink url="http://www.espertech.com/products/">EsperHA</ulink>.
			</para>

			<para>
				The number and type of statements is a factor that cannot be generically accounted for.
				The benchmark kit can help test out some requirements and establish baselines, and for more complex use cases
				a simulation or proof of concept would certainly works best.

			<title>Optimizing Stream Filter Expressions</title>

			<para>
				Assume your EPL statement invokes a static method in the stream filter as the below statement shows as an example:

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent(MyHelperLibrary.filter(field1, field2, field3, field4*field5))]]></programlisting>

			</para>
			
			<para>
				If possible, consider moving some of the checking performed by the function back into the filter or consider splitting the function into a two parts separated by <literal>and</literal> conjunction. In general for all expressions, the engine evaluates expressions left of the <literal>and</literal> first and can skip evaluation of the 
				further expressions in the conjunction in the case when the first expression returns false. In addition the engine can build a reverse index for fields provided in stream or pattern filters.

        <para>
            The benchmark application is basically an Esper event server build with Esper that listens to remote clients
            over TCP.
            Remote clients send MarketData(ticker, price, volume) streams to the event server.
            The Esper event server is started with 1000 statements of one single kind (unless otherwise written),
            with one statement per ticker symbol, unless the statement kind does not depend on the symbol.
            The statement prototype is provided along the results with a '$' instead of the actual ticker symbol value.
            The Esper event server is entirely multithreaded and can leverage the full power of 32bit or 64bit
            underlying hardware multi-processor multi-core architecture.
        </para>

            <para>
                The kit also prints out when starting up the event size and the theoretical maximal throughput you can get on a
                100 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s network. Keep in mind a 100 Mbit/s network will be overloaded at about 400 000 event/s when using our kit despite
                the small size of events.

                        On small hardware, having a lot of thread with slow rate will not help getting high throughput in this

                        intermediate structures to pass the event stream in an asynchronous fashion. This will increase context
                        switching, although if you are using many clients, or are using the <literal>-sleep xxx</literal> (xxx in
                        milliseconds) to simulate a listener delay you may get better performance.

                        It will produce both internal Esper latency (in nanosecond) and also end to end latency (in millisecond, including network time).
                        If you are measuring end to end latency you should make sure your server and client machine(s) are having the same time
                        with f.e. ntpd with a good enough precision.
