        <title>The Service Provider Interface</title>

		<indexterm><primary>EPServiceProviderManager class</primary></indexterm>

        <para>
			The <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> interface represents an engine instance. Each instance of an Esper engine is completely independent of other engine instances and has its own administrative and runtime interface.
        </para>

        <para>
			An instance of the Esper engine is obtained via static methods on the <literal>EPServiceProviderManager</literal> class.
			The <literal>GetDefaultProvider</literal> method and the <literal>GetProvider(String providerURI)</literal> methods return an instance of the Esper engine.
			The latter can be used to obtain multiple instances of the engine for different provider URI values. The <literal>EPServiceProviderManager</literal>
			determines if the provider URI matches all prior provider URI values and returns the same engine instance for the same provider URI value. If the provider URI has not been seen before, it creates a new engine instance.
        </para>

        <para>
			The code snipped below gets the default instance Esper engine. Subsequent calls to get the default engine instance return the same instance.
        </para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[EPServiceProvider epService = EPServiceProviderManager.GetDefaultProvider();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
			This code snippet gets an Esper engine for the provider URI <literal>RFIDProcessor1</literal>. Subsequent calls to get an engine with the same provider URI return the same instance.
        </para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[EPServiceProvider epService = EPServiceProviderManager.GetProvider("RFIDProcessor1");]]></programlisting>
      
        <para>
			Since the <literal>GetProvider</literal> methods return the same cached engine instance for each URI, there is no need to statically cache an engine instance in your application.
        </para>

        <para>
			An existing Esper engine instance can be reset via the <literal>Initialize</literal> method on the <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> instance. This operation stops and removes all statements and 
			resets the engine to the configuration provided when the engine instance for that URI was obtained. If no configuration is provided, an empty (default) configuration applies.
        </para>

        <para>
			After <literal>Initialize</literal> your application must obtain new administrative and runtime services. Any administrative and runtime services obtained before the initialize are invalid and have undefined behavior.
        </para>

        <para>
			The next code snippet outlines a typical sequence of use: 
        </para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[// Configure the engine, this is optional
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.Configure("configuration.xml");	// load a configuration from file
config.XXX = ...;    // make additional configuration settings

// Obtain an engine instance
EPServiceProvider epService = EPServiceProviderManager.GetDefaultProvider(config);

// Optionally, use initialize if the same engine instance has been used before to start clean
epService.Initialize();

// Optionally, make runtime configuration changes
epService.EPAdministrator.GetConfiguration().Add...(...);

// Destroy the engine instance when no longer needed, frees up resources
epService.Dispose();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
			An existing Esper engine instance can be destroyed via the <literal>Dispose</literal> method on the <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> instance. This stops and removes all statements
			as well as frees all resources held by the instance. After a <literal>Dispose</literal> the engine can no longer be used.
        </para>

        <para>
			The <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> exposes a number of events that are used to inform observers when an engine instance is about to be destroyed, after an engine instance has been initialized, when a new statement gets created and when a statement gets started, stopped or destroyed.  Event handlers are registered using the events in the table below.

			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>createPattern</literal> and <literal>CreateEPL</literal> methods return <literal>EPStatement</literal> instances. Statements are automatically started and active when created.

                                    This is the fastest method to receive statement results, as the engine delivers strongly-typed results directly to your application objects without the need for
                                    building an <literal>EventBean</literal> result set as in the Event Handler choice.

                                    There can be at most 1 Subscriber Object registered per statement. If you require more than one event handler, use the event handler instead (or in addition).
                                    The Subscriber Object is bound to the statement with a strongly typed support which ensure direct delivery of new events without type conversion. This optimization
                                    is made possible because there can only be 0 or 1 Subscriber Object per statement.

			<para>
				Your application may attach one or more event handlers, zero or one single subscriber and in addition use the Pull API on the same statement. There are no limitations to the use of enumerator, subscriber or event handler
				alone or in combination to receive statement results.
			</para>
			<para>
				The best delivery performance can generally be achieved by attaching a subscriber and by not attaching event handlers.
                The engine is aware of the event handlers and subscriber attached to a statement. The engine uses this information internally to reduce statement overhead. For example, if your statement does not have event handlers or a subscriber attached, the engine does not need to continuously generate results for delivery.
			</para>

			<para>
				If your application attaches both a subscriber and one or more event handlers then the subscriber receives the result first before any of the event handlers.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				If your application attaches more then one event handler then the event handlers receive results first in the order they were added to the statement, and
				To change the order of delivery among event handlers your application can add and remove event handlers at runtime.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				If you have configured outbound threading, it means a thread from the outbound thread pool delivers results to the subscriber and event handlers instead of the processing or event-sending thread.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				If outbound threading is turned on, we recommend turning off the engine setting preserving the order of events delivered to event handlers as described in <xref linkend="config-engine-threading-dispatch"/>. If outbound threading is turned on statement execution is not blocked for the configured time in the case a subscriber or listener takes too much time.

			<title>Setting a Subscriber Object</title>

			<indexterm><primary>statement</primary><secondary>subscriber object</secondary></indexterm>
			<para>
				A subscriber object is a direct binding of query results to a CLR object. The object receives statement results via method invocation. The subscriber class does not need to implement an interface or extend a superclass. Only one subscriber object may be set for a statement.
			</para>
			
			<para>
			  Subscriber objects have several advantages over event handlers. First, they offer a substantial performance benefit: Query results are delivered directly to your method(s) through method calls, and there is no intermediate representation (<literal>EventBean</literal>). Second, as subscribers receive strongly-typed parameters, the subscriber code tends to be simpler.
			</para>

			<para>
			  This chapter describes the requirements towards the methods provided by your subscriber class.
			</para>
			
			<para>
			  The engine can deliver results to your subscriber in two ways:			 
			</para>
			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Each event in the insert stream results in a method invocation, and each event in the remove stream results in further method invocations. This is termed <emphasis>row-by-row delivery</emphasis>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						A single method invocation that delivers all rows of the insert and remove stream. This is termed <emphasis>multi-row</emphasis> delivery.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>

		    <sect3 id="api-admin-subscriber-rowbyrow">		
				<title>Row-By-Row Delivery</title>
	
				<indexterm><primary>subscriber object</primary><secondary>row-by-row</secondary></indexterm>
				<para>
					Your subscriber class must provide a method by name <literal>Update</literal> to receive insert stream events row-by-row. The number and types of parameters declared by the <literal>Update</literal> method must match the number and types of columns as specified in the <literal>select</literal> clause, in the same order as in the <literal>select</literal> clause.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, if your statement is:
				</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select orderId, price, count(*) from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Then your subscriber <literal>Update</literal> method looks as follows:
				</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[public class MySubscriber {
  ...
  public void Update(String orderId, double price, long count) {...}
  ...
}]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Each method parameter declared by the <literal>Update</literal> method must be assignable from the respective column type as listed in the <literal>select</literal>-clause, in the order selected. The assignability rules are:
				</para>

				<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Widening of types follows CLR standards. For example, if your <literal>select</literal> clause selects an integer value, the method parameter for the same column can be typed int, long, float or double (or any equivalent boxed type).
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Auto-boxing and unboxing follows CLR standards. For example, if your <literal>select</literal> clause selects a <literal>Nullable&lt;int&gt;</literal> value, the method parameter for the same column can be typed <literal>int</literal>. Note that if your <literal>select</literal> clause column may generate <literal>null</literal> values, an exception may occur at runtime unboxing the <literal>null</literal> value.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Interfaces and super-classes are honored in the test for assignability. Therefore <literal>System.Object</literal> can be used to accept any <literal>select</literal> clause column type
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>

				<sect4 id="api-admin-subscriber-rowbyrow-wildcard">		
					<title>Wildcards</title>
	
					<para>
						If your <literal>select</literal> clause contains one or more wildcards (*), then the equivalent parameter type is the underlying event type of the stream selected from.
					</para>

					<para>
						For example, your statement may be:
					</para>
					<programlisting><![CDATA[select *, count(*) from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>

					</para>
					<programlisting><![CDATA[select *, count(*) from OrderEvent order, OrderHistory hist]]></programlisting>

				EPL statements and event patterns publish old data and new data to registered <literal>UpdateEventHandlers</literal>. 
				New data published by statements is the events representing the new values of derived data held by the statement.
				Old data published by statements constists of the events representing the prior values of derived data held by the statement.
			</para>		

			<para>			
				It is important to understand that <literal>UpdateEventHandlers</literal> receive multiple result rows in one invocation by the engine: the new data and old data parameters to your event handler are array parameters. For example, if your application uses one of the batch data windows, or your application creates a pattern that matches multiple times when a single event arrives, then the engine indicates such multiple result rows in one invocation and your new data array carries two or more rows.
			</para>		

			<para>			
				The <literal>UpdateEventArgs</literal> object that is passed as part of the event handler is especially useful when the same event handler is
				registered with multiple statements, as the event argumetns contain the statement and engine instance in addition to the new and old data
				when the engine indicates new results to a event handler.

				<para>
					When using the <literal>AddEventHandlerWithReplay</literal> method to register an event handler, the event handler receives current statement results as the first invocation of the delegate, passing in the newEvents parameter the current statement results as an array of zero or more events.

			<para>
				Subscribing to events posted by a statement is following a push model. The engine pushes data to event handlers when events are received that cause data to change or patterns to match. Alternatively, you need to know that statements serve up data that your application can obtain via the <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> methods on <literal>EPStatement</literal>. This is called the pull API and can come in handy if your application is not interested in all new updates, and only needs to perform a frequent or infrequent poll for the latest data. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> method on <literal>EPStatement</literal> returns a concurrency-safe enumerator returning current statement results, even while concurrent threads may send events into the engine for processing. The safe enumerator guarantees correct results even as events are being processed by other threads. The cost is that the enumerator obtains and holds a statement lock that must be released via the <literal>Dispose</literal> method on the <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> instance. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method on <literal>EPStatement</literal> returns a concurrency-unsafe enumerator. This enumerator is only useful for applications that are single-threaded, or applications that themselves perform coordination between the iterating thread and the  threads that send events into the engine for processing. The advantage to this enumerator is that it does not hold a lock.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next code snippet shows a short example of use of safe iterators:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[EPStatement statement = epAdmin.CreateEPL("select avg(price) as avgPrice from MyTick");
// .. send events into the engine
// then use the pull API...
IEnumerator<EventBean> safeEnum = statement.GetSafeEnumerator();
while(safeEnum.MoveNext()) {
 // .. process event ..
 EventBean @event = safeEnum.Current;
 Console.WriteLine("avg:" + @event.Get("avgPrice");
}
]]></programlisting>

			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[double averagePrice = (double) eplStatement.FirstOrDefault().Get("average");]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				The <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> methods can be used to pull results out of all statements, including statements that join streams, contain aggregation functions, pattern statements, and statements that contain a <literal>where</literal> clause, <literal>group by</literal> clause, <literal>having</literal> clause or <literal>order by</literal> clause.
			</para>

			<para>
				For statements without an <literal>order by</literal> clause, the <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method returns events in the order maintained by the data window. For statements that contain an <literal>order by</literal> clause, the <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method returns events in the order indicated by the <literal>order by</literal> clause.
			</para>

			<para>
				Consider using the <literal>on-select</literal> clause and a named window if your application requires iterating over a partial result set or requires indexed access for fast iteration; Note that <literal>on-select</literal> requires that you sent a trigger event, which may contain the key values for indexed access.

						In multithreaded applications, use the <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> method. Note: make sure your application closes the iterator via the <literal>Close</literal> method when done, otherwise the iterated statement stays locked and event processing for that statement does not resume.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						In multithreaded applications, the <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method does not hold any locks.

					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Since the <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> methods return events to the application immediately, the iterator does not honor an output rate limiting clause, if present. That is, the iterator returns results as if there is no output-rate clause for the statement in statements without grouping or aggregation. For statements with grouping or aggregation, the iterator in combintion with an output clause returns last output group and aggregation results. Use a separate statement and the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to control the output rate for iteration, if so required.

        </para>
        
        <para>
			The below code snippet shows how to send a CLR object event to the engine. Note that the <literal>SendEvent</literal> method is overloaded. As events can take on different representation types, the <literal>SendEvent</literal> takes parameters to reflect the different

        <para>
			Events, in theoretical terms, are observations of a state change that occurred in the past. Since one cannot change an event that happened in the past, events are best modelled as immutable objects. 
        </para>

        <para>
			Note that the Esper engine relies on events that are sent into an engine to not change their state. Typically, applications create a new event object for every new event, to represent that new event. Application should not modify an existing event that was sent into the engine.
        </para>

        <para>
			Another important method in the runtime interface is the <literal>Route</literal> method. This method is designed for use by <literal>UpdateEventHandler</literal> and subscriber implementations that

				Composite events are events that aggregate one or more other events. Composite events are typically created by the engine for statements that join two event streams, and for event patterns in which the causal events are retained and reported in a composite event. The example below shows such an event pattern.

        <para>
			Esper is designed from the ground up to operate as a component to multi-threaded, highly-concurrent applications that require efficient use of resources. In addition, multi-threaded execution requires guarantees in predictability of results and deterministic processing. This section discusses these concerns in detail. 
        </para>

		<para>
In Esper, an engine instance is a unit of separation. Applications can obtain and discard (initialize) one or more engine instances within the same application domain and can provide the same or different engine configurations to each instance. An engine instance efficiently shares resources between statements. For example, consider two statements that declare the same data window. The engine matches up view declarations provided by each statement and can thus provide a single data window representation shared between the two statements.
        </para>

        <para>
			Applications can use Esper APIs to concurrently, by multiple threads of execution, perform such functions as creating and 
managing statements, or sending events into an engine instance for processing. Applications can use application-managed threads or thread pools or any set of same or different threads of execution with any of the public Esper APIs. There are no restrictions towards threading other then those noted in specific sections of this document. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
Esper does not prescribe a specific threading model. Applications using Esper retain full control over threading, allowing an engine to be easily embedded and used as a component or library in your favorite container or process.
        </para>

        <para>
In the default configuration it is up to the application code to use multiple threads for processing events by the engine, if so desired. All event processing takes places within your application thread call stack. The exception is timer-based processing if your engine instance relies on the internal timer (default). If your application relies on external timer events instead of the internal timer then there need not be any Esper-managed internal threads.
        </para>

        <para>
The fact that event processing can take place within your application thread's call stack makes developing applications with Esper easier: Any .NET integrated development environment (IDE) can host an Esper engine instance. This allows developers to easily set up test cases, debug through listener code and inspect input or output events, or trace their call stack.
        </para>
        
		<para>
In the default configuration, each engine instance maintains a single timer thread (internal timer) providing for time or schedule-based processing within the engine. The default resolution at which the internal timer operates is 100 milliseconds. The internal timer thread can be disabled and applications can instead send external time events to an engine instance to perform timer or scheduled processing at the resolution required by an application.
        </para>
        
		<para>
Each engine instance performs minimal locking to enable high levels of concurrency. An engine instance locks on a statement level to protect statement resources.
        </para>

		<para>
For an engine instance to produce predictable results from the viewpoint of event handlers to statements, an engine instance by default ensures that 
it dispatches statement result events to event handlers in the order in which a statement produced result events. Applications that require the highest possible concurrency and do not require predictable order of delivery of events to event handlers, this feature can be turned off via configuration, see
<xref linkend="config-engine-threading-dispatch"/>. For example, assume thread T1 processes an event applied to statement S producing output event O1. Assume thread T2 processes another event applied to statement S and produces output event O2.  The engine employs a configurable latch system to ensure that event handlers to statement S receive and may complete processing of O1 before receiving O2. When using outbound threading (advanced threading options) or changing the configuration this guarantee is weakened or removed.
        </para>

		<para>
In multithreaded environments, when one or more statements make result events available via the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to further statements, the engine preserves the order of events inserted into the generated insert-into stream, allowing statements that consume other statement's events to behave deterministic. This feature can also be turned off via configuration, see , see <xref linkend="config-engine-threading-insert-into"/>. For example, assume thread T1 processes an event applied to statement S and thread T2 processes another event applied to statement S.  Assume statement S inserts into into stream ST. T1 produces an output event O1 for processing by consumers of ST1 and T2 produces an output event O2 for processing by consumers of ST. The engine employs a configurable latch system such that O1 is processed before O2 by consumers of ST. When using route execution threading (advanced threading options) or changing the configuration this guarantee is weakened or removed.
        </para>

		<para>
We generally recommended that listener implementations block minimally or do not block at all. By implementing listener code as non-blocking code execution threads can often achieve higher levels of concurrency.
        </para>

		<para>
We recommended that, when using a single listener or subscriber instance to receive output from multiple statements, that the listener or subscriber code is multithread-safe. If your application has shared state between
listener or subscriber instances then such shared state should be thread-safe.

				In the default configuration the same application thread that invokes any of the <literal>SendEvent</literal> methods will process the event fully and also deliver output events to event handlers and subscribers. By default the single internal timer thread based on system time performs time-based processing and delivery of time-based results. 
			</para>

			<para>
				This default configuration reduces the processing overhead associated with thread context switching, is lightweight and fast and works well in many environments such as J2EE, server or client.

				<emphasis>Route Execution Threading</emphasis> means that the thread sending in an event via any of the <literal>SendEvent</literal> methods (or the inbound threading pooled thread if inbound threading is enabled) only identifies and pre-processes an event, and a pool of engine-managed threads handles the actual processing of the event for each statement, pushing threading to the level of each statement for event-arrival-based execution.

				Care should be taken to consider arrival rates and queue depth. Threading options utilize unbound queues or capacity-bound queues with blocking-put, depending on your configuration, and may therefore introduce an overload or blocking situation to your application. You may use the service provider interface as outlined below to manage queue sizes, if required, and to help tune the engine to your application needs. Consider throttling down the event send rate when the API (see below) indicates that events are getting queued.

			There are two modes for an engine to keep track of time: The internal timer based on JVM system time (the default), and externally-controlled time giving your application full control over the concept of time within an engine or isolated service.
        </para>

        <para>
			An isolated service is an execution environment separate from the main engine runtime, allowing full control over the concept of time for a group of statements, as further described in <xref linkend="api-isolatedservice"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
			By default the internal timer provides time and evaluates schedules. External clocking can be used to supply time ticks to the engine instead. The latter is useful for testing time-based event sequences or for synchronizing the engine with an external time source.
        </para>

        <para>
			The internal timer relies on the windows multimedia timer (default) for time tick events.  The windows multimedia timer provides the finest granularity available on a Windows based platform (1 millisecond) but requires integration of the multimedia DLL. The next section describes timer resolution for the internal timer, by default set to 100 milliseconds but is configurable via the threading options. When using externally-controlled time the timer resolution is in your control.
        </para>

        <para>
			To disable the internal timer and use externally-provided time instead, there are two options. The first option is to use the configuration API at engine initialization time. The second option toggles on and off the internal timer at runtime, via special timer control events that are sent into the engine like any other event.

		<para>
			When sending external timer events, your application should make sure that <literal>long</literal>-type time values are ascending. That is, each long-type value should be either the same value or a larger value then the prior value provided by a <literal>CurrentTimeEvent</literal>. The engine outputs a warning if time events move back in time.

			Exception handlers receive any EPL statement unchecked exception such as internal exceptions or exceptions thrown by plug-in aggregation functions or plug-in views.

        <para>
			Metrics reporting is a feature that allows an application to receive ongoing reports about key engine-level and statement-level metrics. Examples are the number of incoming events, the CPU time and wall time taken by statement executions or the number of output events per statement.
        </para>

        <para>
			Metrics reporting is, by default, disabled. To enable reporting, please follow the steps as outlined in <xref linkend="config-engine-instrumentation"/>. Metrics reporting must be enabled at engine initialization time. Reporting intervals can be controlled at runtime via the <literal>ConfigurationOperations</literal> interface available from the administrative API.
        </para>

        <para>
			Your application receives metrics at configurable intervals via EPL statement. A metric datapoint is simply a well-defined event. The events are <literal>EngineMetric</literal> and <literal>StatementMetric</literal> and the type representing the events can be found in the client API in package <literal>com.espertech.esper.client.metric</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
			Since metric events are processed by the engine the same as application events, your EPL may use any construct on such events. For example, your application may select, filter, aggregate properties, sort or insert into a stream or named window all metric events the same as application events.
        </para>
        
        <para>

        <para>
			Make sure to have metrics reporting enabled since only then do event handlers or subscribers to a statement such as above receive metric events.
        </para>        

        <para>
			The engine provides metric events after the configured interval of time has passed. By default, only started statements that have activity within an interval (in the form of event or timer processing) are reported upon.
        </para>        

        <para>
			The default configuration performs the publishing of metric events in an Esper daemon thread under the control of the engine instance. Metrics reporting honors externally-supplied time, if using external timer events. 
        </para>        

        <para>
			Via runtime configuration options provided by <literal>ConfigurationOperations</literal>, your application may enable and disable metrics reporting globally, provided that metrics reporting was enabled at initialization time.

			When using Esper under .NET, one is sure to run into some differences that make it noticably different that Java.  For example, Java does not have an explicit notion of properties; however, this concept is native to the CLR.  Another difference is in how events are handled; in Java, it is common to expose an interface that is implemented by the event receiver; in the CLR, its common to expose an event handler that requires a delegate that the event receiver provides.
