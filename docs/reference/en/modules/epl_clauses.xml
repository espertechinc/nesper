        <title>EPL Introduction</title>

        <para>
			The Event Processing Language (EPL) is a SQL-like language with <literal>SELECT</literal>, <literal>FROM</literal>, <literal>WHERE</literal>, <literal>GROUP BY</literal>, <literal>HAVING</literal> and <literal>ORDER BY</literal> clauses. Streams replace tables as the source of data with events replacing rows as the basic unit of data. Since events are composed of data, the SQL concepts of correlation through joins, filtering and aggregation through grouping can be effectively leveraged.
        </para>

        <para>
			The <literal>INSERT INTO</literal> clause is recast as a means of forwarding events to other streams for further downstream processing. External data accessible through JDBC may be queried and joined with the stream data. Additional clauses such as the <literal>PATTERN</literal> and <literal>OUTPUT</literal> clauses are also available to provide the missing SQL language constructs specific to event processing.
        </para>

        <para>
			The purpose of the <literal>UPDATE</literal> clause is to update event properties. Update takes place before an event applies to any selecting statements or pattern statements.
        </para>

        <para>
			EPL statements are used to derive and aggregate information from one or more streams of events, and to join or merge event streams. This section outlines EPL syntax. It also outlines the built-in views, which are the building blocks for deriving and aggregating information from event streams. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
			EPL statements contain definitions of one or more views. Similar to tables in a SQL statement, views define the data available for querying and filtering. 
			Some views represent windows over a stream of events. Other views derive statistics from event properties, group events or handle unique event property values.
            Views can be staggered onto each other to build a chain of views. The Esper engine makes sure that views are reused among EPL statements for efficiency.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			The built-in set of views is:
         </para>

		<orderedlist spacing="compact">
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Data window views: <literal>win:length</literal>, <literal>win:length_batch</literal>, <literal>win:time</literal>, <literal>win:time_batch</literal>, <literal>win:time_length_batch</literal>, <literal>win:time_accum</literal>, <literal>win:ext_timed</literal>, <literal>ext:sort_window</literal>, <literal>ext:time_order</literal>, <literal>std:unique</literal>, <literal>std:groupwin</literal>, <literal>std:lastevent</literal>, <literal>std:firstevent</literal>, <literal>std:firstunique</literal>, <literal>win:firstlength</literal>,  <literal>win:firsttime</literal>.

				</para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

        <para>
			EPL provides the concept of <emphasis>named window</emphasis>. Named windows are data windows that can be inserted-into and deleted-from by one or more statements, and that can queried by one or more statements. Named windows have a global character, being visible and shared across an engine instance beyond a single statement. Use the <literal>CREATE WINDOW</literal> clause to create named windows. Use the <literal>ON MERGE</literal> clause to atomically merge events into named window state, the <literal>INSERT INTO</literal> clause to insert data into a named window, the <literal>ON DELETE</literal> clause to remove events from a named window, the <literal>ON UPDATE</literal> clause to update events held by a named window and the <literal>ON SELECT</literal> clause to perform a query triggered by a pattern or arriving event on a named window. Finally, the name of the named window can occur in a statement's <literal>FROM</literal> clause to query a named window or include the named window in a join or subquery.
        </para>

        <para>
			EPL allows execution of on-demand (fire-and-forget, non-continuous, triggered by API) queries against named windows through the runtime API. The query engine automatically indexes named window data for fast access by <literal>ON SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE</literal> without the need to create an index explicitly. For fast on-demand query execution via runtime API use the <literal>CREATE INDEX</literal> syntax to create an explicit index.
        </para>

        <para>
			Use <literal>CREATE SCHEMA</literal> to declare an event type.
        </para>

        <para>
			<emphasis>Variables</emphasis> can come in handy to parameterize statements and change parameters on-the-fly and in response to events. Variables can be used in an expression anywhere in a statement as well as in the output clause for dynamic control of output rates.
        </para>

        <para>
			Esper can be extended by plugging-in custom developed views and aggregation functions.

    <sect1 id="epl-select-syntax">
        <title>EPL Syntax</title>
        
		<para>
			EPL queries are created and stored in the engine, and publish results to listeners as events are received by the engine or timer events occur that match the criteria specified in the query. Events can also be obtained from running EPL queries via the <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> methods that provide a pull-data API.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause in an EPL query specifies the event properties or events to retrieve. The <literal>from</literal> clause in an EPL query specifies the event stream definitions and stream names to use. The <literal>where</literal> clause in an EPL query specifies search conditions that specify which event or event combination to search for. For example, the following statement returns the average price for IBM stock ticks in the last 30 seconds.
		</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select avg(price) from StockTick.win:time(30 sec) where symbol='IBM']]></programlisting>

		<para>
			EPL queries follow the below syntax. EPL queries can be simple queries or more complex queries. A simple select contains only a <literal>select</literal> clause and a single stream definition. Complex EPL queries can be build that feature a more elaborate select list utilizing expressions, may join multiple streams, may contain a <literal>where</literal> clause with search conditions and so on.

			<title>Using Comments</title>
			<para>
				Comments can appear anywhere in the EPL or pattern statement text where whitespace is allowed. Comments can be written in two ways: slash-slash (<literal>// ...</literal>) comments and slash-star (<literal>/* ... */</literal>) comments.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				Slash-slash comments extend to the end of the line:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// This comment extends to the end of the line.
// Two forward slashes with no whitespace between them begin such comments.

select * from MyEvent  // this is a slash-slash comment

// All of this text together is a valid statement.]]></programlisting>

				Slash-star comments can span multiple lines:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[/* This comment is a "slash-star" comment that spans multiple lines.
 * It begins with the slash-star sequence with no space between the '/' and '*' characters.
 * By convention, subsequent lines can begin with a star and are aligned, but this is 
 * not required.
 */		
select * from MyEvent  /* this also works */]]></programlisting>

			<title>Reserved Keywords</title>
			<indexterm><primary>keywords</primary></indexterm>

			<para>
				Certain words such as <literal>select</literal>, <literal>delete</literal> or <literal>set</literal> are reserved and may not be used as identifiers. Please consult <xref linkend="appendix_keywords"/> for the list of reserved keywords and permitted keywords.
			</para>

			<para>
				Names of built-in functions and certain auxiliary keywords are permitted as event property names and in the rename syntax of the <literal>select</literal> clause. For example, <literal>count</literal> is acceptable. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Consider the example below, which assumes that <literal>'last'</literal> is an event property of MyEvent:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// valid
select last, count(*) as count from MyEvent]]></programlisting>
		
			<para>
				This example shows an incorrect use of a reserved keyword:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// invalid
select insert from MyEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				EPL offers an escape syntax for reserved keywords: Event properties as well as event or stream names may be escaped via the backwards apostrophe <literal>`</literal> (ASCII 96) character.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example queries an event type by name <literal>Order</literal> (a reserved keyword) that provides a property by name <literal>insert</literal> (a reserved keyword):

		<sect2 id="epl-syntax-escapestring">
			<title>Escaping Strings</title>
			<indexterm><primary>escape</primary></indexterm>

			<para>
				You may surround string values by either double-quotes (<literal>"</literal>) or single-quotes (<literal>'</literal>). When your string constant in an EPL statement itself contains double quotes or single quotes,
				you must escape the quotes.
			</para>

			<para>
				Double and single quotes may be escaped by the backslash (<literal>\</literal>) character or by unicode notation. Unicode 0027 is a single quote (<literal>'</literal>) and 0022 is a double quote (<literal>"</literal>).
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample EPL below escapes the single quote in the string constant <literal>John's</literal>, and filters out order events where the name value matches:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from OrderEvent(name='John\'s')
// ...equivalent to...
select * from OrderEvent(name='John\u0027s')]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next EPL escapes the string constant <literal>Quote "Hello"</literal>:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from OrderEvent(description like "Quote \"Hello\"")
// is equivalent to
select * from OrderEvent(description like "Quote \u0022Hello\u0022")]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				When building an escape string via the API, escape the backslash, as shown in below code snippet:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[epService.getEPAdministrator().createEPL("select * from OrderEvent(name='John\\'s')");
// ... and for double quotes...
epService.getEPAdministrator().createEPL("select * from OrderEvent(
  description like \"Quote \\\"Hello\\\"\")");]]></programlisting>

			<title>Annotation</title>
			<indexterm><primary>annotation</primary></indexterm>

			<para>
				An annotation is an addition made to information in a statement. Esper provides certain built-in annotations for defining statement name, adding a statement description or for tagging statements such as for managing statements or directing statement output. 
				Other then the built-in annotations, applications can provide their own annotation classes that the EPL compiler can populate.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				An annotation is part of the statement text and precedes the EPL select or pattern statement. Annotations are therefore part of the EPL grammar. The syntax for annotations follows the host language (Java, .NET) annotation syntax:
			</para>
			<synopsis>@<emphasis>annotation_name</emphasis> [(<emphasis>annotation_parameters</emphasis>)]</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				An annotation consists of the annotation name and optional annotation parameters. The <emphasis>annotation_name</emphasis> is the simple class name or fully-qualified class name of the annotation class. The optional <emphasis>annotation_parameters</emphasis> 
				are a list of key-value pairs following the syntax:
			</para>
			<synopsis>@<emphasis>annotation_name</emphasis> (<emphasis>attribute_name</emphasis> = <emphasis>attribute_value</emphasis>, [name=value, ...])</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				The <emphasis>attribute_name</emphasis> is an identifier that must match the attributes defined by the annotation class. An <emphasis>attribute_value</emphasis> is a constant of any of the primitive types or string, an array, an enumeration value or another (nested) annotation. Null values are not allowed as annotation attribute values. Enumeration values are supported in EPL statements and not support in statements created via the <literal>CreatePattern</literal> method.
			</para>

				Use the <literal>Attributes</literal> property of <literal>EPStatement</literal> to obtain annotations provided via statement text.

					To enable the engine to recognize application annotation classes, your annotation name must include the package name (i.e. be fully-qualified) or your engine configuration must import the annotation class or package via the configuration API.  
				</para>

				An EPL statement can contain expression declarations. Expressions that are common to multiple places in an EPL statement can be moved to a named expression declaration and reused within the statement without duplicating the expression itself.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				An expression declaration follows the lambda-style expression syntax. This syntax was chosen as it typically allows for a shorter and more concise expression body that can be easier to read then most procedural code. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The syntax for an expression declaration is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>expression <emphasis>expression_name</emphasis> { <emphasis>expression_body</emphasis> }</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				An expression declaration consists of the expression name and an expression body. The <emphasis>expression_name</emphasis> is any identifier. The <emphasis>expression_body</emphasis> contains optional parameters and the expression.
				The parameter types and the return type of the expression is determined by the engine and do not need to be specified.

			</para>
		
			<para>
				In the expression body the <literal>=&gt;</literal> lambda operator reads as "goes to". The left side of the lambda operator specifies the input parameters (if any) and the right side holds the expression. The lambda expression <literal>x => x * x</literal> is read "x goes to x times x".
			</para>
		
			<para>
				In the expression body, if your expression takes no parameters, you may simply specify the expression and do not need the <literal>=&gt;</literal> lambda operator.
			</para>

		<indexterm><primary>EPL</primary><secondary>select clause</secondary></indexterm>
		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause is required in all EPL statements. The <literal>select</literal> clause can be used to select all properties via the wildcard <literal>*</literal>, or to specify a list of event properties and expressions. The <literal>select</literal> clause defines the event type (event property names and types) of the resulting events published by the statement, or pulled from the statement via the iterator methods.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause also offers optional <literal>istream</literal>, <literal>irstream</literal> and <literal>rstream</literal> keywords to control whether input stream, remove stream or input and remove stream events are posted to <literal>UpdateEventHandler</literal> instances and observers to a statement. By default, the engine provides only the insert stream to listener and observers. See <xref linkend="config-engine-stream-selection"/> on how to change the default.
		</para>

		<para>
			The syntax for the <literal>select</literal> clause is summarized below.
		</para>

		<synopsis>select [istream | irstream | rstream] [distinct] * | <emphasis>expression_list</emphasis> ... </synopsis>

		<para>
			The <literal>istream</literal> keyword is the default, and indicates that the engine only delivers insert stream events to listeners and observers. The <literal>irstream</literal> keyword indicates that the engine delivers both insert and remove stream. Finally, the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword tells the engine to deliver only the remove stream.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>distinct</literal> keyword outputs only unique rows depending on the column list you have specified after it. It must occur after the <literal>select</literal> and after the optional stream keywords, as described in more detail below.

			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTick(symbol='IBM').win:time(30 sec)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
			  You may well be asking: Why does the statement specify a time window here? First, the statement is meant to demonstrate the use of <literal>*</literal> wildcard. 
			  When the engine pushes statement results to your listener and as the statement does not select remove stream events via <literal>rstream</literal> keyword, the listener receives only new events and the time window could be left off.
			  By adding the time window the pull API (iterator API or JDBC driver) returns the last 30 seconds of events.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>*</literal> wildcard and expressions can also be combined in a <literal>select</literal> clause. The combination selects all event properties and in addition the computed values
				as specified by any additional expressions that are part of the <literal>select</literal> clause. Here is an example that selects all properties of stock tick events plus a computed product of price and volume that the 
				statement names 'pricevolume':
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select *, price * volume as pricevolume from StockTick]]></programlisting>

				When using wildcard (*), Esper does not actually copy your event properties out of your event or events. It simply wraps your native type in an <literal>EventBean</literal> interface. Your application has access to

				If your statement is joining multiple streams, your may specify property names that are unique among the joined streams, or use wildcard (*) as explained earlier.
			</para>

			<para>
				In case the property name in your <literal>select</literal> or other clauses is not unique considering all joined streams, you will need to use the name of the stream as a prefix to the property.
			</para>

			<para>
				This example is a join between the two streams StockTick and News, respectively named as 'tick' and 'news'. The example selects from the StockTick event the symbol value using the 'tick' stream name as a prefix:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.symbol from StockTick.win:time(10) as tick, News.win:time(10) as news
where news.symbol = tick.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Use the wildcard (*) selector in a join to generate a property for each stream, with the property value being the event itself. The output events of the statement below have two properties: the 'tick' property holds the StockTick event and the 'news' property holds the News event:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTick.win:time(10) as tick, News.win:time(10) as news]]></programlisting>

			</para>
			<synopsis>select <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>.* [as <emphasis>name</emphasis>] from ...</synopsis>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.* from StockTick.win:time(10) as tick, News.win:time(10) as news
where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example uses the <literal>as</literal> keyword to name each stream's joined events. This instructs the engine to create a property for each named event:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.* as stocktick, news.* as news 
from StockTick.win:time(10) as tick, News.win:time(10) as news
where stock.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The output events of the above example have two properties 'stocktick' and 'news' that are the StockTick and News events.
			</para>

			<para>
				The stream name itself, as further described in <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-stream-name"/>, may be used within expressions or alone. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This example passes events to a user-defined function named <literal>compute</literal> and also shows <literal>insert-into</literal> to populate an event stream of combined events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into TickNewStream select tick, news, MyLib.compute(news, tick) as result

			<programlisting><![CDATA[// second statement that uses the TickNewStream stream
select tick.price, news.text, result from TickNewStream]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In summary, the <emphasis>stream_name.*</emphasis> streamname wildcard syntax can be used to select a stream as the underlying event or as a property, but cannot appear within an expression. While the <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis> syntax (without wildcard) always selects a property (and not as an underlying event), and can occur anywhere within an expression.

        <sect2 id="epl-select-pattern" >
           <title>Choosing event properties and events from a pattern</title>
           
			<para>
				If your statement employs pattern expressions, then your pattern expression tags events with a tag name. Each tag name becomes available for use as a property in the <literal>select</literal> clause and all other clauses.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				For example, here is a very simple pattern that matches on every StockTick event received within 30 seconds after start of the statement. The sample selects the symbol and price properties of the matching events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.symbol as symbol, tick.price as price
from pattern[every tick=StockTick where timer:within(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The use of the wildcard selector, as shown in the next statement, creates a property for each tagged event in the output. The next statement outputs events that hold a single 'tick' property whose value is the event itself:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from pattern[every tick=StockTick where timer:within(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				You may also select the matching event itself using the <literal>tick.*</literal> syntax. The engine outputs the StockTick event itself to listeners:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.* from pattern[every tick=StockTick where timer:within(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				A tag name as specified in a pattern is a valid expression itself. This example uses the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to make available the events matched by a pattern to further statements:

				The following EPL statement shows event type, filter criteria and views combined in one statement. It selects all event properties for the last 100 events of IBM stock ticks for volume. In the example, the event type is the fully qualified type name <literal>org.esper.example.StockTick</literal>. The expression filters for events where the property <literal>symbol</literal> has a value of "IBM". The optional view specifications for deriving data from the StockTick events are a length window and a view for computing statistics on volume. The name for the event stream is "volumeStats".

				Esper filters out events in an event stream as defined by filter criteria before it sends events to subsequent views. Thus, compared to search conditions in a <literal>where</literal> clause, filter criteria remove unneeded events early. In the above example, events with a symbol other then IBM do not enter the time window.

        <sect2 id="epl-from-clause-patterns" >
           <title>Pattern-based Event Streams</title>
			<para>
				Event pattern expressions can also be used to specify one or more event streams in an EPL statement.
				For pattern-based event streams, the event stream definition <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> consists of the keyword <literal>pattern</literal> and a pattern expression in brackets <literal>[]</literal>. The syntax for an event stream definition using a pattern expression is below. As in filter-based event streams, an optional list of views that derive data from the stream can be supplied.
			</para>
			
			<synopsis>pattern [<emphasis>pattern_expression</emphasis>] [.<emphasis>view_spec</emphasis>] [.<emphasis>view_spec</emphasis>] [...]</synopsis>

			<para>
				The next statement specifies an event stream that consists of both stock tick events and trade events. The example tags stock tick events with the name "tick" and trade events with the name "trade".
			</para>			
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select * from pattern [every tick=StockTickEvent or every trade=TradeEvent]]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				This statement generates an event every time the engine receives either one of the event types. The generated events resemble a map with "tick" and "trade" keys. For stock tick events, the "tick" key value is the underlying stock tick event, and the "trade" key value is a null value. For trade events, the "trade" key value is the underlying trade event, and the "tick" key value is a null value.
			</para>			

			<para>
				Lets further refine this statement adding a view the gives us the last 30 seconds of either stock tick or trade events. Lets also select prices and a price total.
			</para>			
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select tick.price as tickPrice, trade.price as tradePrice,

			<para>
				Note that in the statement above <literal>tickPrice</literal> and <literal>tradePrice</literal> can each be null values depending on the event processed. Therefore, an aggregation function such as <literal>sum(tick.price + trade.price))</literal> would always return null values as either of the two price properties are always a null value for any event matching the pattern. Use the <literal>coalesce</literal> function to handle null values, for example: <literal>sum(coalesce(tick.price, 0) + coalesce(trade.price, 0))</literal>.
			</para>

        <sect2 id="epl-from-clause-view-spec" >
           <title>Specifying Views</title>
			<para>
				Views are used to specify an expiry policy for events (data window views) and also to derive data. Views can be staggered onto each other. See the section <xref linkend="epl-views"/> on the views available that also outlines the different types of views: Data Window views and Derived-Value views.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				Views can optionally take one or more parameters. These parameters are expressions themselves that may consist of any combination of variables, arithmetic, user-defined function or substitution parameters for prepared statements, for example.
			</para>

			<para>
				The example statement below outputs a count per expressway for car location events (contains information about the location of a car on a highway) of the last 60 seconds:
			</para>
				
         <programlisting><![CDATA[select expressway, count(*) from CarLocEvent.win:time(60) 
group by expressway]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example serves to show staggering of views. It uses the <literal>std:groupwin</literal> view to create a separate length window per car id:
			</para>
				
         <programlisting><![CDATA[select cardId, expressway, direction, segment, count(*) 
from CarLocEvent.std:groupwin(carId).win:length(4) 
group by carId, expressway, direction, segment]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The first view <literal>std:groupwin(carId)</literal> groups car location events by car id. The second view <literal>win:length(4)</literal> keeps a length window of the 4 last events, with one separate length window for each car id. The example reports the number of events per car id and per expressway, direction and segment considering the last 4 events for each car id only. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Note that the <literal>group by</literal> syntax is generally preferable over <literal>std:groupwin</literal> for grouping information as it is SQL-compliant, easier to read and does not create a separate data window per group. The <literal>std:groupwin</literal> in above example creates a separate data window (length window in the example) per group, demonstrating staggering views.
			</para>

			<para>
				When views are staggered onto each other as a chain of views, then the insert and remove stream received by each view is the insert and remove stream made available by the view (or stream) earlier in the chain. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The special keep-all view keeps all events: It does not provide a remove stream, i.e. events are not removed from the keep-all view unless by means of the <literal>on-delete</literal> syntax or by revision events.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="epl-from-clause-view-multidatawindow" >
		   <title>Multiple Data Window Views</title>
		   <para>
			   Data window views provide an expiry policy that indicates when to remove events from the data window, with the exception of the keep-all data window which has no expiry policy and the <literal>std:groupwin</literal> grouped-window view for allocating a new data window per group.
		   </para>
		   
		   <para>
			   EPL allows the freedom to use multiple data window views onto a stream and thus combine expiry policies. Combining data windows into an intersection (the default) or a union can achieve a useful strategy for retaining events and expiring events that are no longer of interest. Named windows and the <literal>on-delete</literal> syntax provide an additional degree of freedom.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   In order to combine two or more data window views there is no keyword required. The <emphasis>retain-intersection</emphasis> keyword is the default and the <emphasis>retain-union</emphasis> keyword may instead be provided for a stream.
		   </para>

			<para>
				The concept of union and intersection come from Set mathematics. In the language of Set mathematics, two sets A and B can be "added" together: The intersection of A and B is the set of all things which are members of both A and B, i.e. the members two sets have "in common". The union of A and B is the set of all things which are members of either A or B. 
			</para>

		   <para>
			   Use the <emphasis>retain-intersection</emphasis> (the default) keyword to retain an intersection of all events as defined by two or more data windows. All events removed from any of the intersected data windows are entered into the remove stream. This is the default behavior if neither retain keyword is specified.
		   </para>

		   <para>
			   Use the <emphasis>retain-union</emphasis> keyword to retain a union of all events as defined by two or more data windows. Only events removed from all data windows are entered into the remove stream.
		   </para>

		   <para>
				As you can see, it is the remove stream that the combined multiple data windows provide which differs when retaining an intersection and retaining a union, the insert stream is the same to all data windows and their staggered views. Therefore, when combining batching data windows with further data windows, the insert stream still remains the insert stream of the set overall (not batched). Consider using <literal>output snapshot</literal> to obtain regular updates instead of combining batch and other data windows.

        <sect2 id="epl-from-clause-stream-name" >
           <title>Using the Stream Name</title>
			<para>
				Your <literal>from</literal> clause may assign a name to each stream. This assigned stream name can serve any of the following purposes.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				First, the stream name can be used to disambiguate property names. The <literal>stream_name.property_name</literal> syntax uniquely identifies which property to select if property names overlap between streams. Here is an example:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select prod.productId, ord.productId from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Second, the stream name can be used with a wildcard (*) character to select events in a join, or assign new names to the streams in a join:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[// Select ProductEvent only
select prod.* from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent]]></programlisting>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[// Assign column names 'product' and 'order' to each event
select prod.* as product, ord.* as order from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Further, the stream name by itself can occur in any expression: The engine passes the event itself to that expression. For example, the engine passes the ProductEvent and the OrderEvent to the user-defined function 'checkOrder':
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select prod.productId, MyFunc.checkOrder(prod, ord) 
from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Last, you may invoke an instance method on each event of a stream, and pass parameters to the instance method as well. Instance method calls are allowed anywhere in an expression.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The next statement demonstrates this capability by invoking a method 'computeTotal' on OrderEvent events and a method 'getMultiplier' on ProductEvent events:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select ord.computeTotal(prod.getMultiplier()) from ProductEvent as prod, OrderEvent as ord]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Instance methods may also be chained: Your EPL may invoke a method on the result returned by a method invocation.
			</para>

			<para>
				Assume that your product event exposes a method <literal>getZone</literal> which returns a zone object. Assume that the Zone class declares a method <literal>checkZone</literal>.
				This example statement invokes a method chain:
			</para>
            <programlisting><![CDATA[select prod.getZone().checkZone("zone 1") from ProductEvent as prod]]></programlisting>

				<title>Using aggregate functions</title>
			
				<para>
					The aggregate functions are <literal>sum, avg, count, max, min, median, stddev, avedev</literal>. You can use aggregate functions to
					calculate and summarize data from event properties.
					For example, to find out the total price for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds, type:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec)</programlisting>

				<para>
					Here is the syntax for aggregate functions: 
				</para>
				<synopsis><emphasis>aggregate_function</emphasis>( [all | distinct] <emphasis>expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					You can apply aggregate functions to all events in an event stream window or other view, or to one or more groups of events. From each set of events to which 
					an aggregate function is applied, Esper generates a single value. 
				</para>

				<para>
					<literal>Expression</literal> is usually an event property name. However it can also be a constant, function, or any combination of event property names, constants, 
					and functions connected by arithmetic operators.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, to find out the average price for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds if the price was doubled:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select avg(price * 2) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 seconds)</programlisting>

				<para>
					You can use the optional keyword <literal>distinct</literal> with all aggregate functions to eliminate duplicate values before the aggregate function is applied. The optional 
					keyword <literal>all</literal> which performs the operation on all events is the default. 
				</para>
			
				<para>
					You can use aggregation functions in a <literal>select</literal> clause and in a <literal>having</literal> clause. You cannot use aggregate functions in a <literal>where</literal> clause, but you can use the <literal>where</literal> clause to restrict the events to which the aggregate is applied. The next query computes the average and sum of the price of stock tick events for the symbol IBM only, for the last 10 stock tick events regardless of their symbol.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select 'IBM stats' as title, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as sumPrice
from StockTickEvent.win:length(10)
where symbol='IBM'</programlisting>				
								
				<para>
					In the above example the length window of 10 elements is not affected by the <literal>where</literal> clause, i.e. all events enter and leave the length window regardless of their symbol. If we only care about the last 10 IBM events, we need to add filter criteria as below.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select 'IBM stats' as title, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as sumPrice
from StockTickEvent(symbol='IBM').win:length(10)

					Esper ignores any null values returned by the event property or expression on which the aggregate function is operating, except for the <literal>count(*)</literal> function, which counts null values as well.

				<para>
					The <literal>group by</literal> clause is optional in all EPL statements. The <literal>group by</literal> clause divides the output of an EPL statement into groups. You can group by one or more event property names, or by the result of computed expressions. When used with aggregate functions, <literal>group by</literal> retrieves the calculations in each subgroup. You can use <literal>group by</literal> without aggregate functions, but generally that can produce confusing results.

				<para>
					For example, the below statement returns the total price per symbol for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) group by symbol</programlisting>
	
				<para>
					The syntax of the <literal>group by</literal> clause is:
				</para>
				<synopsis>group by <emphasis>aggregate_free_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>aggregate_free_expression</emphasis>] [, ...]</synopsis>
			
				<para>
					Esper places the following restrictions on expressions in the <literal>group by</literal> clause:
				</para>
	
				<orderedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Expressions in the <literal>group by</literal> cannot contain aggregate functions
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Event properties that are used within aggregate functions in the <literal>select</literal> clause cannot also be used in a <literal>group by</literal> expression
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							When grouping an unbound stream, i.e. no data window is specified onto the stream providing groups, or when using output rate limiting with the ALL keyword, you should ensure your group-by expression does not return an unlimited number of values. If, for example, your group-by expression is a fine-grained timestamp, group state that accumulates for an unlimited number of groups potentially reduces available memory significantly.
							Use a @Hint as described below to instruct the engine when to discard group state.
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
				
				<para>
					You can list more then one expression in the <literal>group by</literal> clause to nest groups. Once the sets are established with <literal>group by</literal> the aggregation
					functions are applied. This statement posts the median volume for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds per symbol and tick data feed. Esper posts one event for each group to statement listeners:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, median(volume) 
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) 
group by symbol, tickDataFeed</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					In the statement above the event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list (symbol, tickDataFeed) are also listed in the <literal>group by</literal> clause.
					The statement thus follows the SQL standard which prescribes that non-aggregated event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list must match the 
					<literal>group by</literal> columns.
				</para>

				<para>
					Esper also supports statements in which one or more event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list are not listed in the <literal>group by</literal> clause.
					The statement below demonstrates this case. It calculates the standard deviation for the last 30 seconds of stock ticks aggregating by symbol and posting for 
					each event the symbol, tickDataFeed and the standard deviation on price.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, stddev(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) group by symbol</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					The above example still aggregates the <literal>price</literal> event property based on the <literal>symbol</literal>, but produces one event per incoming event, not one 
					event per group.
				</para>

				<para>
					Additionally, Esper supports statements in which one or more event properties in the <literal>group by</literal> clause are not listed in the <literal>select</literal> list.
					This is an example that calculates the mean deviation per <literal>symbol</literal> and <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> and posts one event per group with <literal>symbol</literal> and mean deviation of price in the generated events. Since tickDataFeed is not in the posted results, this can potentially be confusing.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, avedev(price) 
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) 
group by symbol, tickDataFeed</programlisting>

				<para>
					Expressions are also allowed in the <literal>group by</literal> list:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol * price, count(*) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) group by symbol * price</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					If the <literal>group by</literal> expression resulted in a null value, the null value becomes its own group. All null values are aggregated into the same group. If you are using the <literal>count(expression)</literal> aggregate function which does not count null values, the count returns zero if only null values are encountered.								
				</para>

				<para>
					You can use a <literal>where</literal> clause in a statement with <literal>group by</literal>. Events that do not satisfy the conditions in the <literal>where</literal> clause are eliminated before any grouping is done. For example, the statement below posts the number of stock ticks in the last 30 seconds with a volume larger then 100, posting one event per group (symbol).
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, count(*) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) where volume &gt; 100 group by symbol</programlisting>

					<para>
						The Esper engine reclaims aggregation state agressively when it determines that a group has no data points, based on the data in the data windows. When your application data creates a large number of groups with a small or zero number of data points then performance may suffer as state is reclaimed and created anew. Esper provides the <literal>@Hint('disable_reclaim_group')</literal> hint that you can specify as part of an EPL statement text to avoid group reclaim.
					</para>

					<para>
						When aggregating values over an unbound stream (i.e. no data window is specified onto the stream) and when your group-by expression returns an unlimited number of values, for example when a timestamp expression is used, 
						then please note the next hint.

					<programlisting>// Note the below statement could lead to an out-of-memory problem:

					<para>
						As the engine has no means of detecting when aggregation state (sums per symbol) can be discarded, you may use the following hints to control aggregation state lifetime.
					</para>
					
					<para>
						The @Hint("<literal>reclaim_group_aged=</literal><emphasis>age_in_seconds</emphasis>") hint instructs the engine to discard aggregation state that has not been

					</para>
					
					<para>
						The optional @Hint("<literal>reclaim_group_freq=</literal><emphasis>sweep_frequency_in_seconds</emphasis>") can be used in addition to control the frequency at which the engine sweeps aggregation 
						state to determine aggregation state age and remove state that is older then <emphasis>age_in_seconds</emphasis> seconds.
						If the hint is not specified, the frequency defaults to the same value as <emphasis>age_in_seconds</emphasis>.
					</para>

					<para>

				<para>
					Use the <literal>having</literal> clause to pass or reject events defined by the <literal>group-by</literal> clause. The <literal>having</literal> clause sets conditions for the <literal>group by</literal> clause in the same way <literal>where</literal> sets conditions for the <literal>select</literal> clause, except <literal>where</literal> cannot include aggregate functions, while <literal>having</literal> often does.
				</para>
			
				<para>
					This statement is an example of a <literal>having</literal> clause with an aggregate function. It posts the total price per symbol for the last 30 seconds of stock tick events for only those symbols in which the total price exceeds 1000. The <literal>having</literal> clause eliminates all symbols where the total price is equal or less then 1000.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) 
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) 
group by symbol 
having sum(price) &gt; 1000</programlisting>

				<para>
					To include more then one condition in the <literal>having</literal> clause combine the conditions with <literal>and</literal>, <literal>or</literal> or <literal>not</literal>.
					This is shown in the statement below which selects only groups with a total price greater then 1000 and an average volume less then 500.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price), avg(volume)
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) 
group by symbol 
having sum(price) &gt; 1000 and avg(volume) &lt; 500</programlisting>			

				<para>
					A statement with the <literal>having</literal> clause should also have a <literal>group by</literal> clause. If you omit <literal>group-by</literal>, all the events not excluded
					by the <literal>where</literal> clause return as a single group. In that case <literal>having</literal> acts like a <literal>where</literal> except that <literal>having</literal> can have aggregate functions. 
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The <literal>having</literal> clause can also be used without <literal>group by</literal> clause as the below example shows. The example below posts events where the price is less then the current running average price of all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds.

				<para>
					Esper filters events using the filter criteria for the event stream <literal>StockTickEvent</literal>. In the example above only events with symbol IBM enter the length window over the last 10 events, all other events are simply discarded. The <literal>where</literal> clause removes any events posted by the length window (events entering the window and event leaving the window) that do not match the condition of volume greater then 1000. Remaining events are applied to the <literal>stddev</literal> standard deviation aggregate function for each tick data feed as specified in the <literal>group by</literal> clause. Each <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> value generates one event. Esper applies the <literal>having</literal> clause and only lets events pass for <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> groups with a standard deviation of price greater then 0.8.

        <sect2 id="epl-group-by-versus-view" >
			 <title>Comparing the <emphasis>Group By</emphasis> clause and the <emphasis>std:groupwin</emphasis> view</title>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause as well as the built-in <emphasis>std:groupwin</emphasis> view are similar in their ability to group events. This section explains the key differences in their behavior and use.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause works together with aggregation functions in your statement to produce an aggregation result per group. In greater detail, this means that when a new event arrives, the engine applies the expressions in the <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause to determine a grouping key. If the engine has not encountered that grouping key before (a new group), the engine creates a set of new aggregation results for that grouping key and performs the aggregation changing that new set of aggregation results. If the grouping key points to an existing set of prior aggregation results (an existing group), the engine performs the aggregation changing the prior set of aggregation results for that group.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>std:groupwin</emphasis> view is a built-in view that also groups events. The view is described in greater detail in <xref linkend="view-std-groupwin"/>. Its primary use is to create a separate data window per group, or more generally to create separate instances of all its sub-views for each grouping key encountered.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example shows two queries that produce equivalent results. The query using the <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause is generally preferable as is easier to read. The second form introduces the <literal>stat:uni</literal> view which computes univariate statistics for a given property:
			</para>

			<programlisting>select symbol, avg(price) from StockTickEvent group by symbol
// ... is equivalent to ...
select symbol, average from StockTickEvent.std:groupwin(symbol).stat:uni(price)</programlisting>

			<para>
				The next example shows two queries that are NOT equivalent as the length window is ungrouped in the first query, and grouped in the second query:
			</para>

			<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:length(10) group by symbol
// ... NOT equivalent to ...
select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent.std:groupwin(symbol).win:length(10)</programlisting>

			<para>
				The key difference between the two statements is that in the first statement the length window is ungrouped and applies to all events regardless of group. While in the second query each group gets its own instance of a length window. For example, in the second query events arriving for symbol "ABC" get a length window of 10 events, and events arriving for symbol "DEF" get their own length window of 10 events.

				<title>Output Clause Options</title>
			
				<para>
					The <literal>output</literal> clause is optional in Esper and is used to control or stabilize the rate at which events are output and to suppress output events. The EPL language provides for several different ways to control output rate.
				</para>

				<para>
					Here is the syntax for the <literal>output</literal> clause that specifies a rate in time interval or number of events:
				</para>
				<synopsis>output [after <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis>] 
  [[all | first | last | snapshot] every <emphasis>output_rate</emphasis> [seconds | events]]</synopsis>

				<para>
					An alternate syntax specifies the time period between output as outlined in <xref linkend="epl-syntax-time-periods"/> :
				</para>
				<synopsis>output [after <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis>] 
  [[all | first | last | snapshot] every <emphasis>time_period</emphasis>]</synopsis>

				<para>
					A crontab-like schedule can also be specified. The schedule parameters follow the pattern observer parameters and are further described in <xref linkend="pattern-timer-at"/> :
				</para>
				<synopsis>output [after <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis>] 
  [[all | first | last | snapshot] at 
   (<emphasis>minutes, hours, days of month, months, days of week [, seconds]</emphasis>)]</synopsis>

				<para>
					Last, output can be controlled by an expression that may contain variables, user-defined functions and information about the number of collected events. Output that is controlled by an expression is discussed in detail below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>after</literal> keyword and <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis> can appear alone or together with further output conditions and suppresses output events.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, the following statement outputs, every 60 seconds, the total price for all orders in the 30-minute time window:		
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select sum(price) from OrderEvent.win:time(30 min) output snapshot every 60 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
					The <literal>all</literal> keyword is the default and specifies that all events in a batch should be output, each incoming row in the batch producing an output row.
					Note that for statements that group via the <literal>group by</literal> clause, the <literal>all</literal> keyword provides special behavior as below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>first</literal> keyword specifies that only the first event in an output batch is to be output.
					Using the <literal>first</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output the first matching event as soon as it arrives, and then ignores matching events for the time interval or number of events specified. 
					After the time interval elapsed, or the number of matching events has been reached, the next first matching event is output again and the following interval the engine again ignores matching events.
					For statements that group via the <literal>group by</literal> clause, the <literal>first</literal> keywords provides special behavior as below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>last</literal> keyword specifies to only output the last event at the end of the given time interval or after the given number of matching events
					have been accumulated. Again, for statements that group via the <literal>group by</literal> clause the <literal>last</literal> keyword provides special behavior as below.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>snapshot</literal> keyword indicates that the engine output current computation results considering all events as per views specified and/or current aggregation results. While the other keywords control how a batch of events between output intervals is being considered, the <literal>snapshot</literal> keyword outputs all current state of a statement independent of the last batch. Its output is equivalent to the <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method provided by a statement. The <literal>snapshot</literal> keyword requires a data window declaration if not used within a join and outputs only the last event if used without a data window.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <emphasis>output_rate</emphasis> is the frequency at which the engine outputs events. It can be specified in terms of time or number of events. The value can be a number to denote a fixed output rate, or the name of a variable whose value is the output rate. By means of a variable the output rate can be controlled externally and changed dynamically at runtime. 
				</para>

				<para>
					Please consult the <xref linkend="appendix_outputspec"/> for detailed information on insert and remove stream output for the various <literal>output</literal> clause keywords.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The time interval can also be specified in terms of minutes; the following statement is identical to the first one.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:length(5) output every 1.5 minutes</programlisting>

				<para>
					A second way that output can be stabilized is by batching events until a certain number of events have been collected. The next statement only outputs when either 5 (or more) new or 5 (or more) old events have been batched.
				</para>				
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) output every 5 events</programlisting>
			    
				<para>
					Additionally, event output can be further modified by the optional <literal>last</literal> keyword, which causes output of only the last event to arrive into an output batch.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:time(30 sec) output last every 5 events</programlisting>

				<para>
					Using the <literal>first</literal> keyword you can be notified at the start of the interval. The allows to watch for situations such as a rate falling below a threshold
					and only be informed every now and again after the specified output interval, but be informed the moment it first happens. 
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from TickRate.win:time(30 seconds) where rate&lt;100 output first every 60 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
					A sample statement using the Unix "crontab"-command schedule is shown next. See <xref linkend="pattern-timer-at"/> for details on schedule syntax. Here, output occurs every 15 minutes from 8am to 5:45pm (hours 8 to 17 at 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes past the hour):

					<para>
						Output can also be controlled by an expression that may check variable values, use user-defined functions and query built-in properties that provide additional information. The synopsis is as follows:
					</para>
					<synopsis>output [after <emphasis>suppression_def</emphasis>] 
  [[all | first | last | snapshot] when <emphasis>trigger_expression</emphasis>

					<para>
						The <literal>when</literal> keyword must be followed by a trigger expression returning a boolean value of true or false, indicating whether to output.
						Use the optional <literal>then</literal> keyword to change variable values after the trigger expression evaluates to true. An assignment expression assigns a new value to variable(s).
					</para>

					<para>
						Lets consider an example. The next statement assumes that your application has defined a variable by name OutputTriggerVar of boolean type. The statement outputs rows only when the OutputTriggerVar variable has a boolean value of true:
					</para>
					<synopsis>select sum(price) from StockTickEvent output when OutputTriggerVar = true</synopsis>

					<para>
						The engine evaluates the trigger expression when streams and data views post one or more insert or remove stream events after considering the <literal>where</literal> clause, if present. It also evaluates the trigger expression when any of the variables used in the trigger expression, if any, changes value. Thus output occurs as follows:
					</para>

					<orderedlist spacing="compact">
						<listitem>
							<para>
								When there are insert or remove stream events and the <literal>when</literal> trigger expression evaluates to true, the engine outputs the resulting rows.

								When any of the variables in the <literal>when</literal> trigger expression changes value, the engine evaluates the expression and outputs results. Result output occurs within the minimum time interval of timer resolution (100 milliseconds).
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</orderedlist>

					<para>
						By adding a <literal>then</literal> part to the EPL, we can reset any variables after the trigger expression evaluated to true:

					</para>
					<synopsis>output after <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> | <emphasis>number</emphasis> events [...]</synopsis>

					<para>
						When using <literal>after</literal> either alone or together with further output conditions, the engine discards all output events until the time period passed as measured from the start of the statement, or until the
						number of output events are reached. The discarded events are not output and do not count towards any further output conditions if any are specified.
					</para>

					<para>
						For example, the following statement outputs every minute the total price for all orders in the 30-minute time window but only after 30 minutes have passed:		
					</para>
					<programlisting>select sum(price) from OrderEvent.win:time(30 min) output after 30 min snapshot every 1 min</programlisting>

					<para>
						An example in which <literal>after</literal> occur alone is below, in a statement that outputs total price for all orders in the last minute but only after 1 minute passed, each time an event arrives or leaves the data window:
					</para>
					<programlisting>select sum(price) from OrderEvent.win:time(1 min) output after 1 min</programlisting>

					<para>
						To demonstrate <literal>after</literal> when used with an event count, this statement find pairs of orders with the same id but suppresses output for the first 5 pairs:

				<title>Aggregation, Group By, Having and Output clause interaction</title>
			
				<para>
					Remove stream events can also be useful in conjunction with aggregation and the <literal>output</literal> clause: When the engine posts remove stream events for fully-aggregated queries, it presents the aggregation state before the expiring event leaves the data window. Your application can thus easily obtain a delta between the new aggregation value and the prior aggregation value.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The engine evaluates the having-clause at the granularity of the data posted by views. That is, if you utilize a time window and output every 10 events, the <literal>having</literal> clause applies to each individual event or events entering and leaving the time window (and not once per batch of 10 events).
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>output</literal> clause interacts in two ways with the <literal>group by</literal> and <literal>having</literal> clauses. First, in the <literal>output every n events </literal>case, the number <literal>n</literal> refers to the number of events arriving into the <literal>group by clause</literal>. That is, if the <literal>group by</literal> clause outputs only 1 event per group, or if the arriving events don't satisfy the <literal>having</literal> clause, then the actual number of events output by the statement could be fewer than <literal>n</literal>.
				</para>
				
				<para>
					Second, the <literal>last</literal>, <literal>all</literal> and <literal>first</literal> keywords have special meanings when used in a statement with aggregate functions and the <literal>group by</literal> clause:
				</para>
				<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>
							When no keyword is specified, the engine produces an output row for each row in the batch or when using group-by then an output per group only for those groups present in the batch, following <xref linkend="processingmodel_aggregation_output"/>.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The <literal>all</literal> keyword (the default) specifies that the most recent data for <emphasis>all</emphasis> groups seen so far should be output, whether or not these groups' aggregate values have just been updated
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The <literal>last</literal> keyword specifies that only groups whose aggregate values have been updated with the most recent batch of events should be output.
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							The <literal>first</literal> keyword specifies that only groups whose aggregate values have been updated with the most recent batch of events should be output following the defined frequency, keeping frequency state for each group.

				<para>
					Please consult the <xref linkend="appendix_outputspec"/> for detailed information on insert and remove stream output for aggregation and group-by.

					By adding an output rate limiting clause to a statement that contains a <emphasis>group by</emphasis> clause we can control output of groups to obtain one row for each group, generating an event per group at the given output frequency.
				</para>
				
				<para>
				  The next statement outputs total price per symbol cumulatively (no data window was used here). As it specifies the <literal>all</literal> keyword, the statement outputs the current value for all groups seen so far, regardless of whether the group was updated in the last interval. Output occurs after an interval of 5 seconds passed and at the end of each subsequent interval:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent group by symbol output all every 5 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
				  The below statement outputs total price per symbol considering events in the last 3 minutes. When events leave the 3-minute data window output also occurs as new aggregation values are computed. The <literal>last</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output only those groups that had changes. Output occurs after an interval of 10 seconds passed and at the end of each subsequent interval:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(3 min)
group by symbol output last every 10 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
				  This statement also outputs total price per symbol considering events in the last 3 minutes. The <literal>first</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output as soon as there is a new value for a group. After output for a given group the engine suppresses output for the same group for 10 seconds and does not suppress output for other groups. Output occurs again for that group after the interval when the group has new value(s):
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(3 min)
group by symbol output first every 10 seconds</programlisting>

		<para>
			The <literal>limit</literal> clause is typically used together with the <literal>order by</literal> and <literal>output</literal> clause to limit your query results to those that fall within a specified range. You can use it to receive the first given number of result rows, or to receive a range of result rows.

		</para>
		<synopsis>limit <emphasis>row_count</emphasis> [offset <emphasis>offset_count</emphasis>]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The required <emphasis>row_count</emphasis> parameter specifies the number of rows to output. The <emphasis>row_count</emphasis> can be an integer constant 
			and can also be the name of the integer-type variable to evaluate at runtime.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>insert into</literal> clause is optional in Esper. The clause can be specified to make the results of a statement available as an event stream for use

		<para>
			The <literal>istream</literal> (default) and <literal>rstream</literal> keywords are optional. If no keyword or the <literal>istream</literal> keyword is specified, the engine supplies the insert stream events generated by the statement.

				A <emphasis>variant stream</emphasis> is a predefined stream into which events of multiple disparate event types can be inserted. 
			</para>

			<para>
				A variant stream name may appear anywhere in a pattern or <literal>from</literal> clause. In a pattern, a filter against a variant stream matches any events of any of the event types inserted into the variant stream. 
				In a <literal>from</literal> clause including for named windows, views declared onto a variant stream may hold events of any of the event types inserted into the variant stream.
			</para>

			<para>
				A variant stream is thus useful in problems that require different types of event to be treated the same.
			</para>

			<para>
				Variant streams can be declared by means of <literal>create variant schema</literal> or can be predefined via runtime or initialization-time configuration as described in <xref linkend="config-variantstream"/>. Your application may declare or predefine variant streams to carry events of a limited set of event types, or you may choose the variant stream to carry any and all types of events. This choice affects what event properties are available for consuming statements or patterns of the variant stream.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				Assume that an application predefined a variant stream named <literal>OrderStream</literal> to carry only <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> and <literal>ProductOrder</literal> events. An <literal>insert into</literal> clause inserts events into
				the variant stream:
			</para>
			<programlisting>insert into OrderStream select * from ServiceOrder</programlisting>			
			<programlisting>insert into OrderStream select * from ProductOrder</programlisting>			

			<para>
				Here is a sample statement that consumes the variant stream and outputs a total price per customer id for the last 30 seconds of <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> and <literal>ProductOrder</literal> events:
			</para>
			<programlisting>select customerId, sum(price) from OrderStream.win:time(30 sec) group by customerId</programlisting>			

			<para>
				If your application predefines the variant stream to hold specific type of events, as the sample above did, then all event properties that are common to all specified types are visible on the variant stream, including nested, indexed and mapped properties. For access to properties that are only available on one of the types, the dynamic property syntax must be used. In the example above, the <literal>customerId</literal> and <literal>price</literal> were properties common to both <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> and <literal>ProductOrder</literal> events.
			</para>		

			<para>
				For example, here is a consuming statement that selects a <literal>service duraction</literal> property that only <literal>ServiceOrder</literal> events have, and that must therefore be casted to double and null values removed in order to aggregate:
			</para>
			<programlisting>select customerId, sum(coalesce(cast(serviceDuraction?, double), 0)) 
from OrderStream.win:time(30 sec) group by customerId</programlisting>			

			<para>
				If your application predefines a variant stream to hold any type of events (the <literal>any</literal> type variance), then all event properties of the variant stream are effectively dynamic properties.

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select assetId, (select zone from ZoneClosed.std:lastevent()) as lastClosed from RFIDEvent]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			If the inner query is dependent on the outer query, we will have a correlated subquery. An example of a correlated subquery is shown below. Notice the <literal>where</literal> clause in the inner query, where the condition involves a stream from the outer query:
	    </para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent as RFID where 'Dock 1' = 
  (select name from Zones.std:unique(zoneId) where zoneId = RFID.zoneId)]]></programlisting>
		
		<para>
			The example above shows a subquery in the <literal>where</literal> clause. The statement selects RFID events in which the zone name matches a string constant based on zone id. The statement uses the view <literal>std:unique</literal> to guarantee that only the last event per zone id is held from processing by the subquery.
		</para>

		<para>
			The next example is a correlated subquery within a <literal>select</literal> clause. In this statement the <literal>select</literal> clause retrieves the zone name by means of a subquery against the Zones set of events correlated by zone id:
		</para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select zoneId, (select name from Zones.std:unique(zoneId) 
  where zoneId = RFID.zoneId) as name from RFIDEvent]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Note that when a simple or correlated subquery returns multiple rows, the engine returns a <literal>null</literal> value as the subquery result. To limit the number of events returned by a subquery consider using one of the views <literal>std:lastevent</literal>, <literal>std:unique</literal> and <literal>std:groupwin</literal> or aggregation functions or the multi-row and multi-column selects as described below.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>select</literal> clause of a subquery also allows wildcard selects, which return as an event property the underlying event object of the event type as defined in the <literal>from</literal> clause. An example:
		</para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select (select * from MarketData.std:lastevent()) as md 
  from pattern [every timer:interval(10 sec)]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The output events to the statement above contain the underlying MarketData event in a property named "md". The statement populates the last MarketData event into a property named "md" every 10 seconds following the pattern definition, or populates a <literal>null</literal> value if no MarketData event has been encountered so far.
		</para>

		<para>
			When your subquery returns multiple rows, you must use an aggregation function in the <literal>select</literal> clause of the subselect, as a subquery can only return a single row and single value object. To return multiple values from a subquery,
			consider writing a custom aggregation function that returns an array or collection of values.
		</para>

		<para>
			Aggregation functions may be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause of the subselect as this example outlines:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MarketData
where price > (select max(price) from MarketData(symbol='GOOG').std:lastevent())]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			As the sub-select expression is evaluated first (by default), the query above actually never fires for the GOOG symbol, only for other symbols that have a price higher then the current maximum for GOOG. As a sidenote, the <literal>insert into</literal> clause can also be handy to compute aggregation results for use in multiple subqueries.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			When using aggregation functions in a correlated subselect the engine computes the aggregation based on data window or named window contents matching the where-clause.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The following example compares the quantity value provided by the current order event against the total quantity of all order events in the last 1 hour for the same client.
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from OrderEvent oe
where qty > 
  (select sum(qty) from OrderEvent.win:time(1 hour) pd 
  where pd.client = oe.client)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Filter expressions in a pattern or stream may also employ subqueries. Subqueries can be uncorrelated or can be correlated to properties of the stream or to properties of tagged events in a pattern. Subqueries may reference named windows as well.
		</para>

		<para>
			The following example filters <literal>BarData</literal> events that have a close price less then the last moving average (field <literal>movAgv</literal>) as provided by stream <literal>SMA20Stream</literal> (an uncorrelated subquery):
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from BarData(ticker='MSFT', closePrice < 
    (select movAgv from SMA20Stream(ticker='MSFT').std:lastevent()))]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			A few generic examples follow to demonstrate the point. The examples use short event and property names so they are easy to read. Assume <literal>A</literal> and <literal>B</literal> are streams and <literal>DNamedWindow</literal> is a named window, and properties <literal>a_id, b_id, d_id, a_val, b_val, d_val</literal> respectively:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[// Sample correlated subquery as part of stream filter criteria
select * from A(a_val in 
  (select b_val from B.std:unique(b_val) as b where a.a_id = b.b_id)) as a]]></programlisting>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[// Sample correlated subquery against a named window
select * from A(a_val in 
  (select b_val from DNamedWindow as d where a.a_id = d.d_id)) as a]]></programlisting>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[// Sample correlated subquery in the filter criteria as part of a pattern, querying a named window
select * from pattern [
  a=A -> b=B(bvalue = 
    (select d_val from DNamedWindow as d where d.d_id = b.b_id and d.d_id = a.a_id))
]]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Subquery state starts to accumulate as soon as a statement starts (and not only when a pattern-subexpression activates).
		</para>

		<para>
			The following restrictions apply to subqueries:
		</para>

		<orderedlist spacing="compact">
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The subquery stream definition must define a data window or other view to limit subquery results, reducing the number of events held for subquery execution
				</para>
			</listitem>

				<para>
					Subqueries can only consist of a <literal>select</literal> clause, a <literal>from</literal> clause and a <literal>where</literal> clause.

		</orderedlist>

		<para>
			The order of evaluation of subqueries relative to the containing statement is guaranteed: If the containing statement and its subqueries are reacting to the same type of event, the subquery will receive the
			event first before the containing statement's clauses are evaluated. This behavior can be changed via configuration. The order of evaluation of subqueries is not guaranteed between subqueries.
		</para>

		<para>
			Performance of your statement containing one or more subqueries principally depends on two parameters. First, if your subquery correlates one or more columns in the subquery stream with the enclosing statement's streams, the engine automatically builds the appropriate indexes for fast row retrieval based on the key values correlated (joined). The second parameter is the number of rows found in the subquery stream and the complexity of the filter criteria (<literal>where</literal> clause), as each row in the subquery stream must evaluate against the <literal>where</literal> clause filter.

			<title>Hints Related to Subqueries</title>

			<para>
				The following hints are available to tune performance and memory use of subqueries.
			</para>

			<para>
				Use the <literal>@Hint('set_noindex')</literal> hint for a statement that utilizes one or more subqueries. It instructs the engine to always perform a full table scan. The engine does not build an implicit index or use an explicitly-created index when this hint is provided. Use of the hint may result in reduced memory use but poor statement performance.
			</para>

			<para>
				The following hints are available to tune performance and memory use of subqueries that select from named windows.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Named windows are globally-visible data windows. As such an application may create explicit indexes as discussed in <xref linkend="named_explicit_index"/>. The engine may also elect to create implicit indexes (no create-index EPL required) for index-based lookup of rows when executing <literal>on-select</literal>, <literal>on-merge</literal>, <literal>on-update</literal> and <literal>on-delete</literal> statements and for statements that subquery a named window.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				By default and without specifying a hint, each statement that subqueries a named window also maintains its own index for looking up events held by the named window. The engine maintains the index by consuming the named window insert and remove stream. When the statement is destroyed it releases that index.
			</para>

			<para>
				Specify the <literal>@Hint('enable_window_subquery_indexshare')</literal> hint to enable subquery index sharing for named windows. When using this hint, indexes for subqueries are maintained by the named window itself (and not each statement), are shared between one or more statements and may also utilize explicit indexes. Specify the hint once as part of the <literal>create window</literal> statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				This sample EPL statement creates a named window with subquery index sharing enabled:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[@Hint('enable_window_subquery_indexshare')
create window AllOrdersNamedWindow.win:keepall() as OrderMapEventType]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				When subquery index sharing is enabled, performance may increase as named window stream consumption is no longer needed. You may also expect reduced memory use especially if a large number of EPL statements perform similar subqueries against a named window. Subquery index sharing may require additional short-lived object creation and may slightly increase lock held time for named windows. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The following statement performs a correlated subquery against the named window above. When a settlement event arrives it select the order detail for the same order id as provided by the settlement event:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select 
  (select * from AllOrdersNamedWindow as onw 
    where onw.orderId = se.orderId) as orderDetail
  from SettlementEvent as se]]></programlisting>
  
			  <para>
				  With subquery index sharing enabled the engine maintains an index of order events by order id for the named window, and shares that index between additional statements until the time all utilizing statements are destroyed.
			  </para>
			
			<para>
				You may disable subquery index sharing for a specific statement by specifying the <literal>@Hint('disable_window_subquery_indexshare')</literal> hint, as this example shows, causing the statement to maintain its own index:

			<para>
				Two or more event streams can be part of the <literal>from</literal>-clause and thus both (all) streams determine the resulting events. This section summarizes the important concepts. The sections that follow present more detail on each topic.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The default join is an inner join which produces output events only when there is at least one match in all streams.
			</para>

			<para>
				Consider the sample statement shown next:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent.std:lastevent(), NewsEvent.std:lastevent()]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The above statement outputs the last TickEvent and the last NewsEvent in one output event when either a TickEvent or a NewsEvent arrives. If no TickEvent was received before a NewsEvent arrives, no output occurs. Similarly when no NewsEvent was received before a TickEvent arrives, no output occurs.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>where</literal>-clause lists the join conditions that Esper uses to relate events in the two or more streams. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example statement retains the last TickEvent and last NewsEvent per symbol, and joins the two streams based on their symbol value:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent.std:unique(symbol) as t, NewsEvent.std:unique(symbol) as n
where t.symbol = n.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				As before, when a TickEvent arrives for a symbol that has no matching NewsEvent then there is no output event.
			</para>

			<para>
				An outer join does not require each event in either stream to have a matching event. The full outer join is useful when output is desired when no match is found. The different outer join types (full, left, right) are explained in more detail below.
			</para>

			<para>
				This example statement is an outer-join and also returns the last TickEvent and last NewsEvent per symbol: 
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent.std:unique(symbol) as t
full outer join NewsEvent.std:unique(symbol) as n on t.symbol = n.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In the sample statement above, when a TickEvent arrives for a symbol that has no matching NewsEvent, or when a NewsEvent arrives for a symbol that has no matching TickEvent, the statement still produces an output event with a null column value for the missing event.
			</para>

			<para>
				Note that each of the sample queries above defines a data window. The sample queries above use the last-event data window (std:lastevent) or the unique data window (std:unique). A data window serves to indicate the subset of events to join from each stream and may be required depending on the join.
			</para>

			<para>
				In above queries, when either a TickEvent arrives or when a NewsEvent arrives then the query evaluates and there is output. The same holds true if additional streams are added to the <literal>from</literal>-clause: Each of the streams in the <literal>from</literal>-clause trigger the join to evaluate.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword instructs the engine to evaluate the join only when an event arrives from the single stream that was marked with the <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword. In this case no data window should be specified for the stream marked as <literal>unidirectional</literal> since the keyword implies that the current event of that stream triggers the join.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Here is the sample statement above with <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword, so that output occurs only when a TickEvent arrives and not when a NewsEvent arrives:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent as t unidirectional, NewsEvent.std:unique(symbol) as n 
where t.symbol = n.symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				It is oftentimes the case that an aggregation (count, sum, average) only needs to be calculated in the context of an arriving event or timer. Consider using the <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword when aggregating over joined streams.
			</para>

			<para>
				An EPL pattern is a normal citizen also providing a stream of data consisting of pattern matches. A time pattern, for example, can be useful to evaluate a join and produce output upon each interval.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This sample statement includes a pattern that fires every 5 seconds and thus triggers the join to evaluate and produce output, computing an aggregated total quantity per symbol every 5 seconds:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, sum(qty) from pattern[every timer:interval(5 sec)] unidirectional, 
  TickEvent.std:unique(symbol) t, NewsEvent.std:unique(symbol) as n 
where t.symbol = n.symbol group by symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Named windows as well as reference and historical data such as stored in your relational database, and data returned by a method invocation, can also be included in joins as discussed in <xref linkend="histdata_overview"/> and <xref linkend="joining_method"/>.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Related to joins are subqueries: A subquery is a <literal>select</literal> within another statement, see <xref linkend="epl-subqueries"/>
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The engine performs extensive query analysis and planning, building internal indexes and strategies as required to allow fast evaluation of many types of queries.

		<sect2 id="epl-join-inner">
			<title>Inner (Default) Joins</title>			
	
			<para>
				Each point in time that an event arrives to one of the event streams, the two event streams are joined and output events are produced according to the <literal>where</literal> clause when matching events are found for all joined streams.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				This example joins 2 event streams. The first event stream consists of fraud warning events for which we keep the last 30 minutes. The second stream is withdrawal events for which we consider the last 30 seconds. The streams are joined on account number.
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select fraud.accountNumber as accntNum, fraud.warning as warn, withdraw.amount as amount,
       max(fraud.timestamp, withdraw.timestamp) as timestamp, 'withdrawlFraud' as desc
  from com.espertech.esper.example.atm.FraudWarningEvent.win:time(30 min) as fraud,
       com.espertech.esper.example.atm.WithdrawalEvent.win:time(30 sec) as withdraw
 where fraud.accountNumber = withdraw.accountNumber]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Joins can also include one or more pattern statements as the next example shows:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from FraudWarningEvent.win:time(30 min) as fraud,
    pattern [every w=WithdrawalEvent -> PINChangeEvent(acct=w.acct)].std:lastevent() as withdraw
 where fraud.accountNumber = withdraw.w.accountNumber]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				The statement above joins the last 30 minutes of fraud warnings with a pattern. The pattern consists of every withdrawal event that is followed by a PIN change event for the same account number. It joins the two event streams on account number. The last-event view instucts the join to only consider the last pattern match.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				In a join and outer join, your statement must declare a data window view or other view onto each stream. Streams that are marked as unidirectional and named windows as well as database or methods in a join are an exception and do not require a view to be specified. If you are joining an event to itself via contained-event selection, views also do not need to be specified.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The next example joins all FraudWarningEvent events that arrived since the statement was started, with the last 20 seconds of PINChangeEvent events:
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from FraudWarningEvent.win:keepall() as fraud, PINChangeEvent.win:time(20 sec) as pin
 where fraud.accountNumber = pin.accountNumber]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The above example employed the special keep-all view that retains all events.

			<para>
				Esper supports left outer joins, right outer joins, full outer joins and inner joins in any combination between an unlimited number of event streams. Outer and inner joins can also join reference and historical data as explained in <xref linkend="histdata_overview"/>, as well as join data returned by a method invocation as outlined in <xref linkend="joining_method"/>.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The keywords <literal>left, right, full</literal> and <literal>inner</literal> control the type of the join between two streams. The <literal>on</literal> clause specifies one or more properties that join each stream. The synopsis is as follows:
			</para>

<synopsis>...from <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> [as name] 
  ((left|right|full outer) | inner) join <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> 
  on <emphasis>property</emphasis> = <emphasis>property</emphasis> [and <emphasis>property</emphasis> = <emphasis>property</emphasis> ...]
  [ ((left|right|full outer) | inner) join <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> on ...]...
</synopsis>

			<para>
				If the outer join is a left outer join, there will be an output event for each event of the stream on the left-hand side of the clause. For example, in the left outer join shown below we will get output for each event in the stream RfidEvent, even if the event does not match any event in the event stream OrderList.
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent.win:time(30 sec) as rfid
       left outer join
       OrderList.win:length(10000) as orderlist
     on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>
		
			<para>
				Similarly, if the join is a Right Outer Join, then there will be an output event for each event of the stream on the right-hand side of the clause. For example, in the right outer join shown below we will get output for each event in the stream OrderList, even if the event does not match any event in the event stream RfidEvent.
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent.win:time(30 sec) as rfid
       right outer join
       OrderList.win:length(10000) as orderlist
       on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				For all types of outer joins, if the join condition is not met, the select list is computed with the event properties of the arrived event while all other event properties are considered to be null.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The next type of outer join is a full outer join. In a full outer join, each point in time that an event arrives to one of the event streams, one or more output events are produced. In the example below, when either an RfidEvent or an OrderList event arrive, one or more output event is produced. The next example shows a full outer join that joins on multiple properties:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent.win:time(30 sec) as rfid
       full outer join
       OrderList.win:length(10000) as orderlist
       on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId and rfid.assetId = orderList.assetId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The last type of join is an inner join. In an inner join, the engine produces an output event for each event of the stream on the left-hand side that matches at least one event on the right hand side considering the join properties. For example, in the inner join shown below we will get output for each event in the RfidEvent stream that matches one or more events in the OrderList data window:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent.win:time(30 sec) as rfid
       inner join
       OrderList.win:length(10000) as orderlist
       on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId and rfid.assetId = orderList.assetId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Patterns as streams in a join follow this rule: If no data window view is declared for the pattern then the pattern stream retains the last match. Thus a pattern must have matched at least once for the last row to become available in a join. Multiple rows from a pattern stream may be retained by declaring a data window view onto a pattern using the <literal>pattern [...].</literal><emphasis>view_specification</emphasis> syntax.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				Finally, this example outer joins multiple streams. Here the RfidEvent stream is outer joined to both ProductName and LocationDescription via left outer join:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from RfidEvent.win:time(30 sec) as rfid
      left outer join ProductName.win:keepall() as refprod
        on rfid.productId = refprod.prodId
      left outer join LocationDescription.win:keepall() as refdesc
        on rfid.location = refdesc.locId]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In a join or outer join your statement lists multiple event streams, views and/or patterns in the <literal>from</literal> clause. As events arrive into the engine, each of the streams (views, patterns) provides insert and remove stream events. The engine evaluates each insert and remove stream event provided by each stream, and joins or outer joins each event against data window contents of each stream, and thus generates insert and remove stream join results.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The direction of the join execution depends on which stream or streams are currently providing an insert or remove stream event for executing the join. A join is thus multidirectional, or bidirectional when only two streams are joined.
				A join can be made unidirectional if your application does not want new results when events arrive on a given stream or streams.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword can be used in the <literal>from</literal> clause to identify a single stream that provides the events to execute the join. If the keyword is present for a stream, all other streams in the <literal>from</literal> clause become passive streams. When events arrive or leave a data window of a passive stream then the join does not generate join results. 
			</para>
	
			<para>
				For example, consider a use case that requires us to join stock tick events (TickEvent) and news events (NewsEvent). The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword allows to generate results only when TickEvent events arrive, and not when NewsEvent arrive or leave the 10-second time window:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent unidirectional, NewsEvent.win:time(10 sec) 
where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Aggregation functions in a <literal>unidirectional</literal> join aggregate within the context of each unidirectional event evaluation and are not cumulative. Thereby aggregation functions when used with <literal>unidirectional</literal> may evaluate faster as they do not need to consider a remove stream (data removed from data windows or named windows).
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The count function in the next query returns, for each TickEvent, the number of matching NewEvent events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select count(*) from TickEvent unidirectional, NewsEvent.win:time(10 sec) 
where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				The following restrictions apply to unidirectional joins:
			</para>
	
			<orderedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword can only be specified for a single stream in the <literal>from</literal> clause. 
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

						Receiving data from a unidirectional join via the pull API (<literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method) is not allowed. This is because the engine holds no state for the single stream that provides the events to execute the join.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The stream that declares the <literal>unidirectional</literal> keyword cannot declare a data window view or other view for that stream, since remove stream events are not processed for the single stream.

		<sect2 id="epl-join-hints">
			<title>Hints Related to Joins</title>			
			<para>
				When joining 3 or more streams (including any relational or non-relational sources as below) it can sometimes help to provide the query planner instructions how to best execute the join. The engine compiles a query plan for the EPL statement at statement creation time. You can output the query plan to logging (see configuration).
			</para>
			
			<para>
				An outer join that specifies only <literal>inner</literal> keywords for all streams is equivalent to an default (inner) join. The following two statements are equivalent:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent.std:lastevent(), 
    NewsEvent.std:lastevent() where tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Equivalent to:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from TickEvent.std:lastevent() 
	inner join NewsEvent.std:lastevent() on tick.symbol = news.symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				For all types of joins, the query planner determines a query graph: The term is used here for all the information regarding what properties or expressions are used to join the streams. The query graph thus includes the where-clause expressions as well as outer-join on-clauses if this statement is an outer join. The query planner also computes a dependency graph which includes information about all historical data streams (relational and non-relational as below) and their input needs. 
			</para>
			
			<para>
				For default (inner) joins the query planner first attempts to find a path of execution as a nested iteration. For each stream the query planner selects the best order of streams available for the nested iteration considering the query graph and dependency graph. If the full depth of the join is achievable via nested iteration for all streams without full table scan then the query planner uses that nested iteration plan. If not, then the query planner re-plans considering a merge join (Cartesian) approach instead.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Specify the @Hint('PREFER_MERGE_JOIN') to instruct the query planner to prefer a merge join plan instead of a nested iteration plan. Specify the @Hint('FORCE_NESTED_ITER') to instruct the query planner to always use a nested iteration plan. 
			</para>

			<para>
				For example, consider the below statement. Depending on the number of matching rows in OrderBookOne and OrderBookTwo (named windows in this example, and assumed to be defined elsewhere) the performance of the join may be better using the merge join plan.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[@Hint('PREFER_MERGE_JOIN') 
select * from TickEvent.std:lastevent() t, 
	OrderBookOne ob1, OrderBookOne ob2
where ob1.symbol = t.symbol and ob2.symbol = t.symbol 
and ob1.price between t.buy and t.sell and ob2.price between t.buy and t.sell]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				For outer joins the query planner considers nested iteration and merge join (Cartesian) equally and above hints don't apply.

			This chapter outlines how reference data and historical data that are stored in a relational database can be queried via SQL within EPL statements. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Esper can access via join and outer join as well as via enumerator (poll) API all types of event streams to stored data. In order for such data sources to become accessible to Esper, some configuration is required. The <xref linkend="config-database-ref"/> explains the required configuration for database access in greater detail, and includes information on configuring a query result cache.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Esper does not parse or otherwise inspect your SQL query. Therefore your SQL can make use of any database-specific SQL language extensions or features that your database provides.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you have enabled query result caching in your Esper database configuration, Esper retains SQL query results in cache following the configured cache eviction policy. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Also if you have enabled query result caching in your Esper database configuration and provide EPL <literal>where</literal> clause and/or <literal>on</literal> clause (outer join) expressions, then 
			Esper builds indexes on the SQL query results to enable fast lookup. This is especially useful if your queries return a large number of rows. For building the proper indexes, Esper inspects the expression found in your EPL query <literal>where</literal> clause, if present. For outer joins, Esper also inspects your EPL query <literal>on</literal> clause. Esper analyzes the EPL <literal>on</literal> clause and <literal>where</literal> clause expressions, if present, looking for property comparison with or without logical AND-relationships between properties. When a SQL query returns rows for caching, Esper builds and caches the appropriate index and lookup strategies for fast row matching against indexes.
		</para>

		<para>
			Joins or outer joins in which only SQL statements or method invocations are listed in the <literal>from</literal> clause and no other event streams are termed <emphasis>passive</emphasis> joins. A passive join does not produce an insert or remove stream and therefore does not invoke statement listeners with results. A passive join can be iterated on (polled) using a statement's <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> methods.

			<title>Joining SQL Query Results</title>
			
			<para>
				To join an event stream against stored data, specify the <literal>sql</literal> keyword followed by the name of the database and a parameterized SQL query. The syntax to use in the <literal>from</literal> clause of an EPL statement is:
			</para>
	
			<synopsis>sql:<emphasis>database_name</emphasis> [" <emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis> "]</synopsis>
	
			<para>
				The engine uses the <emphasis>database_name</emphasis> identifier to obtain configuration information in order to establish a database connection, as well as settings that control connection creation and removal. Please see <xref linkend="config-database-ref"/> to configure an engine for database access.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				Following the database name is the SQL query to execute. The SQL query can contain one or more substitution parameters. The SQL query string is placed in single brackets <literal>[</literal> and <literal>]</literal>. The SQL query can be placed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). The SQL query grammer is passed to your database software unchanged, allowing you to write any SQL query syntax that your database understands, including stored procedure calls.
			</para>

			<para>
				Substitution parameters in the SQL query string take the form <literal>${</literal><emphasis>expression</emphasis><literal>}</literal>. The engine resolves <emphasis>expression</emphasis> at statement execution time to the actual expression result by evaluating the events in the joined event stream or current variable values, if any event property references or variables occur in the expression. An <emphasis>expression</emphasis> may not contain EPL substitution parameters.
			</para>

			<para>
				The engine determines the type of the SQL query output columns by means of the result set metadata that your database software returns for the statement. The actual 
				query results are obtained via <literal>System.Data.DbDataReader</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample EPL statement below joins an event stream consisting of <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> events with the results of an SQL query against the database named <literal>MyCustomerDB</literal> and table <literal>Customer</literal>: 
			</para>
			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select custId, cust_name from CustomerCallEvent,
  sql:MyCustomerDB [' select cust_name from Customer where cust_id = ${custId} ']]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The example above assumes that <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> supplies an event property named <literal>custId</literal>. The SQL query selects the customer name from the Customer table. The <literal>where</literal> clause in the SQL matches the Customer table column <literal>cust_id</literal> with the value of <literal>custId</literal> in each <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> event. The engine executes the SQL query for each new <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> encountered.
			</para>

			<para>
				If the SQL query returns no rows for a given customer id, the engine generates no output event. Else the engine generates one output event for each row returned by the SQL query. An outer join as described in the next section can be used to control whether the engine should generate output events even when the SQL query returns no rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example adds a time window of 30 seconds to the event stream <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal>. It also renames the selected properties to customerName and customerId to demonstrate how the naming of columns in an SQL query can be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause in the EPL query. And the example uses explicit stream names via the <literal>as</literal> keyword.
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select customerId, customerName from
  CustomerCallEvent.win:time(30 sec) as cce,
  sql:MyCustomerDB ["select cust_id as customerId, cust_name as customerName from Customer 
                  where cust_id = ${cce.custId}"] as cq]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Any window, such as the time window, generates insert stream (istream) events as events enter the window, and remove stream (rstream) events as events leave the window. The engine executes the given SQL query for each <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal> in both the insert stream and the remove stream. As a performance optimization, the <literal>istream</literal> or <literal>rstream</literal> keywords in the <literal>select</literal> clause can be used to instruct the engine to only join insert stream or remove stream events, reducing the number of SQL query executions.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Since any expression may be placed within the <literal>${...}</literal> syntax, you may use variables or user-defined functions as well.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next example assumes that a variable by name <literal>varLowerLimit</literal> is defined and that a user-defined function <literal>getLimit</literal> exists on the <literal>MyLib</literal> imported class that takes a <literal>LimitEvent</literal> as a parameter:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from LimitEvent le, 
  sql:MyCustomerDB [' select cust_name from Customer where 
      amount > ${max(varLowerLimit, MyLib.getLimit(le))} ']]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The example above takes the higher of the current variable value or the value returned by the user-defined function to return only those customer names where the amount exceeds the computed limit.
			</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="histdata_join_where" revision="1">
			<title>SQL Query and the EPL <literal>Where</literal> Clause</title>
			
			<para>
				Consider using the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause to join the SQL query result to your event stream. Similar to EPL joins and outer-joins that join event streams or patterns, the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause provides join criteria between the SQL query results and the event stream (as a side note, an SQL <literal>where</literal> clause is a filter of rows executed by your database on your database server before returning SQL query results).
			</para>

			<para>
				Esper analyzes the expression in the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause and outer-join <literal>on</literal> clause, if present, and builds the appropriate indexes from that information at runtime, to ensure fast matching of event stream events to SQL query results, even if your SQL query returns a large number of rows. Your applications must ensure to configure a cache for your database using Esper configuration, as such indexes are held with regular data in a cache. If you application does not enable caching of SQL query results, the engine does not build indexes on cached data.
			</para>

			<para>
				The sample EPL statement below joins an event stream consisting of <literal>OrderEvent</literal> events with the results of an SQL query against the database named <literal>MyRefDB</literal> and table <literal>SymbolReference</literal>: 
			</para>
			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, symbolDesc from OrderEvent as orders,
  sql:MyRefDB ['select symbolDesc from SymbolReference'] as reference
  where reference.symbol = orders.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Notice how the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause joins the <literal>OrderEvent</literal> stream to the <literal>SymbolReference</literal> table. In this example, the SQL query itself does not have a SQL <literal>where</literal> clause 
				and therefore returns all rows from table <literal>SymbolReference</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				If your application enables caching, the SQL query fires only at the arrival of the first <literal>OrderEvent</literal> event. When the second <literal>OrderEvent</literal> arrives, the join execution uses the cached query result. If the caching policy that you specified in the Esper database configuration evicts the SQL query result from cache, then the engine fires the SQL query again to obtain a new result and places the result in cache.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				If SQL result caching is enabled and your EPL <literal>where</literal> clause, as show in the above example, provides the properties to join, then the engine indexes the SQL query results in cache and retains the index together with the query result in cache. Thus your application can benefit from high performance index-based lookups as long as the SQL query results are found in cache. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The SQL result caches operate on the level of all result rows for a given parameter set. For example, if your query returns 10 rows for a certain set of parameter values then the cache treats all 10 rows as a single entry keyed by the parameter values, and the expiry policy applies to all 10 rows and not to each individual row.
			</para>

			<para>
				It is also possible to join multiple autonomous database systems in a single query, for example:
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, symbolDesc from OrderEvent as orders,
  sql:My_Oracle_DB ['select symbolDesc from SymbolReference'] as reference,
  sql:My_MySQL_DB ['select orderList from orderHistory'] as history
  where reference.symbol = orders.symbol
  and history.symbol = orders.symbol ]]></programlisting>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="histdata_outerjoin" revision="1">
			<title>Outer Joins With SQL Queries</title>

			<para>
				You can use outer joins to join data obtained from an SQL query and control when an event is produced. Use a left outer join, such as in the next statement, if you need an output event for each event regardless of whether or not the SQL query returns rows. If the SQL query returns no rows, the join result populates null values into the selected properties.
			</para>
						
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select custId, custName from

  on cce.custId = cq.cust_id]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The statement above always generates at least one output event for each <literal>CustomerCallEvent</literal>, containing all columns selected by the SQL query, even if the SQL query does not return any rows. Note the <literal>on</literal> expression that is required for outer joins. The <literal>on</literal> acts as an additional filter to rows returned by the SQL query.

		<sect2 id="histdata_polling_pattern" revision="1">
			<title>Using Patterns to Request (Poll) Data</title>

				Pattern statements and SQL queries can also be applied together in useful ways. One such use is to poll or request data from a database at regular intervals or following the schedule of the crontab-like <literal>timer:at</literal>.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				The next statement is an example that shows a pattern that fires every 5 seconds to query the NewOrder table for new orders:
			</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into NewOrders

			<title>No-Metadata Workaround</title>

			<para>
			   Certain database drivers are known to not return metadata for precompiled prepared SQL statements. This can be a problem as metadata is required by Esper. Esper obtains SQL result set metadata to validate an EPL statement and to provide column types for output events. Drivers that do not provide metadata for precompiled SQL statements require a workaround. Such drivers do generally provide metadata for executed SQL statements, however do not provide the metadata for precompiled SQL statements.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Please consult the <xref linkend="configuration"/> for the configuration options available in relation to metadata retrieval.
			</para>

			<para>
				To obtain metadata for an SQL statement, Esper can alternatively fire a SQL statement which returns the same column names and types as the actual SQL statement but without returning any rows. This kind of SQL statement is referred to as a <emphasis>sample</emphasis> statement in below workaround description. The engine can then use the sample SQL statement to retrieve metadata for the column names and types returned by the actual SQL statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				Applications can provide a sample SQL statement to retrieve metadata via the <literal>metadatasql</literal> keyword:
			</para>
			<synopsis>sql:<emphasis>database_name</emphasis> ["<emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis>" metadatasql "<emphasis>sql_meta_query</emphasis>"] </synopsis>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>sql_meta_query</emphasis> must be an SQL statement that returns the same number of columns, the same type of columns and the same column names as the 
				<emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis>, and does not return any rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				Alternatively, applications can choose not to provide an explicit sample SQL statement. If the EPL statement does not use the <literal>metadatasql</literal> syntax, the engine applies lexical analysis to the SQL statement. From the lexical analysis Esper generates a sample SQL statement adding a restrictive clause "where 1=0"  to the SQL statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				Alternatively, you can add the following tag to the SQL statement: <literal>${$ESPER-SAMPLE-WHERE}</literal>. If the tag  exists in the SQL statement, the engine does not perform lexical analysis and simply replaces the 
				tag with the SQL <literal>where</literal> clause "where 1=0". Therefore this workaround is applicable to SQL statements that cannot be correctly lexically analyzed. The SQL text after the placeholder is not part of the sample query. For example:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select mycol from sql:myDB [
  'select mycol from mytesttable ${$ESPER-SAMPLE-WHERE} where ....'], ...]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				If your <emphasis>parameterized_sql_query</emphasis> SQL query contains vendor-specific SQL syntax, generation of the metadata query may fail to produce a valid SQL statement. If you experience an SQL error while fetching metadata, use any of the above workarounds with the Oracle JDBC driver.

		<para>
			Your application may need to join data that originates from a web service, a distributed cache, an object-oriented database or simply data held in memory by your application. Esper accommodates this need by allowing
			a method invocation (or procedure call or function) in the <literal>from</literal> clause of a statement. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			The results of such a method invocation in the <literal>from</literal> clause plays the same role as a relational database table in an inner and outer join in SQL. The role is thus dissimilar to the role of a user-defined function, which may occur in any expression such as in the <literal>select</literal> clause or the <literal>where</literal> clause. Both are backed by one or more static methods provided by your class library.
		</para>

		<para>
			Esper can join and outer join an unlimited number and all types of event streams to the data returned by your method invocation. In addition, Esper can be configured to cache the data returned by your method invocations.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Joins or outer joins in which only SQL statements or method invocations are listed in the <literal>from</literal> clause and no other event streams are termed <emphasis>passive</emphasis> joins. A passive join does not produce an insert or remove stream and therefore does not invoke statement listeners with results. A passive join can be iterated on (polled) using a statement's <literal>GetSafeEnumerator</literal> and <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> methods.
		</para>

		<para>
			The following restrictions currently apply:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
			<listitem>

		<sect2 id="joining_method_syntax" revision="1">
			<title>Joining Method Invocation Results</title>
			<para>
				The syntax for a method invocation in the <literal>from</literal> clause of an EPL statement is:
			</para>
			<synopsis>method:<emphasis>class_name</emphasis>.<emphasis>method_name</emphasis>[(<emphasis>parameter_expressions</emphasis>)]</synopsis>
	
			<para>
				The <literal>method</literal> keyword denotes a method invocation. It is followed by a class name and a method name separated by a dot (.) character. If you have parameters to your method invocation, these are placed in 
				round brackets after the method name. Any expression is allowed as a parameter, and individual parameter expressions are separated by a comma. Expressions may also use event properties of the joined stream. 
			</para>
	
			<para>
				In the sample join statement shown next, the method 'lookupAsset' provided by class 'MyLookupLib' returns one or more rows based on the asset id (a property of the AssetMoveEvent) that is passed to the method:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from AssetMoveEvent, method:MyLookupLib.lookupAsset(assetId)]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				The following statement demonstrates the use of the <literal>where</literal> clause to join events to the rows returned by a method invocation, which in this example does not take parameters:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select assetId, assetDesc from AssetMoveEvent as asset, 
       method:MyLookupLib.getAssetDescriptions() as desc 
where asset.assetid = desc.assetid]]></programlisting>
	
			<para>
				Your method invocation may return zero, one or many rows for each method invocation. If you have caching enabled through configuration, then Esper can avoid the method invocation and instead use cached results. Similar to SQL joins, Esper also indexes cached result rows such that join operations based on the <literal>where</literal> clause or outer-join <literal>on</literal> clause can be very efficient, especially if your method invocation returns a large number of rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				If the time taken by method invocations is critical to your application, you may configure local caches as <xref linkend="config-method-invocations"/> describes.
			</para>

			<para>
				Esper analyzes the expression in the EPL <literal>where</literal> clause and outer-join <literal>on</literal> clause, if present, and builds the appropriate indexes from that information at runtime, to ensure fast matching of event stream events to method invocation results, even if your method invocation returns a large number of rows. Your applications must ensure to configure a cache for your method invocation using Esper configuration, as such indexes are held with regular data in a cache. If you application does not enable caching of method invocation results, the engine does not build indexes on cached data.

				<title>Creation by Modelling after an Existing Type</title>

				<para>
					The benefit of modelling a named window after an existing event type is that event properties can be nested, indexed, mapped or other types that your event objects may provide as properties, including the type of the underlying event itself. Also, using the wildcard (*) operator means your EPL does not need to list each individual property explicitly.
				</para>

				<para>
					The syntax for creating a named window by modelling the named window after an existing event type, is as follows: 
				</para>
				<synopsis>create window <emphasis>window_name</emphasis>.<emphasis>view_specifications</emphasis> 
    [as] [select <emphasis>list_of_properties</emphasis> from] <emphasis>event_type_or_windowname</emphasis>
    [insert [where <emphasis>filter_expression</emphasis>]]</synopsis>
						
				<para>
					The <emphasis>window_name</emphasis> you assign to the named window can be any identifier. The name should not already be in use as an event type or stream name.
				</para>
					
				<para>
					The <emphasis>view_specifications</emphasis> are one or more data window views that define the expiry policy for removing events from the data window. Named windows must explicitly declare a data window view. This is required to ensure that the policy for retaining events in the data window is well defined. To keep all events, use the keep-all view: It indicates that the named window should keep all events and only remove events from the named window that are deleted via the <literal>on delete</literal> clause. The view specification can only list data window views, derived-value views are not allowed since these don't represent an expiry policy. Data window views are listed in <xref linkend="epl-views"/>. View parameterization and staggering are described in <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-view-spec"/>.
				</para>
					
				<para>				
					The <literal>select</literal> clause and <emphasis>list_of_properties</emphasis> are optional. If present, they specify the column names and, implicitly by definition of the event type, the column types of events held by the named window. Expressions other then column names are not allowed in the <literal>select</literal> list of properties. Wildcards (*) and wildcards with additional properties can also be used.
				</para>
	
				<para>				
					The <emphasis>event_type_or_windowname</emphasis> is required if using the model-after syntax. It provides the name of the event type of events held in the data window, unless column names and types have been explicitly selected via <literal>select</literal>. The name of an (existing) other named window is also allowed here. Please find more details in <xref linkend="named_populate_named"/>.
				</para>
	
				<para>				
					Finally, the <literal>insert</literal> clause and optional <emphasis>filter_expression</emphasis> are used if the new named windows is modelled after an existing named window, and the data of the existing named window is to be populated, upon time of creation of the new window, from the existing named window. The optional <emphasis>filter_expression</emphasis> can be used to exclude events.
				</para>

				<para>

				The <literal>insert into</literal> clause inserts events into named windows. Your application must ensure that the column names and types match the declared column names and types of the named window to be inserted into.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				  For inserting into a named window and for simulateously checking if the inserted row already exists in the named window or for atomic update-insert operation on a named window, consider using <literal>on-merge</literal> as described in <xref linkend="named_upsert"/>. On-merge
				  is similar to the SQL <literal>merge</literal> clause and provides what is known as an "Upsert" operation: Update existing events or if no existing event(s) are found then insert a new event, all in one atomic operation provided by a single EPL statement.
			</para>

			<para>
				In this example we first create a named window using some of the columns of an OrderEvent event type:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create window OrdersWindow.win:keepall() as select symbol, volume, price from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				The insert into the named window selects individual columns to be inserted:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into OrdersWindow(symbol, volume, price) select name, count, price from FXOrderEvent]]></programlisting>
			<para>
			  An alternative form is shown next:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into OrdersWindow select name as symbol, vol as volume, price from FXOrderEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Following above statement, the engine enters every FXOrderEvent arriving into the engine into the named window 'OrdersWindow'.
			</para>

			<para>
				The following EPL statements create a named window for an event type backed by a type and insert into the window any 'OrderEvent' where the symbol value is IBM:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create window OrdersWindow.win:time(30) as com.mycompany.OrderEvent]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into OrdersWindow select * from com.mycompany.OrderEvent(symbol='IBM')]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The last example adds one column named 'derivedPrice' to the 'OrderEvent' type by specifying a wildcard, and uses a user-defined function to populate the column:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create window OrdersWindow.win:time(30) as select *, price as derivedPrice from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into OrdersWindow select *, MyFunc.func(price, percent) as derivedPrice from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Event representations based on base classes or interfaces, and subclasses or implementing classes, are compatible as these statements show:

				A named window can be referred to by any statement in the <literal>from</literal> clause of the statement. Filter criteria can also be specified. Additional views may be used onto named windows however such views cannot include data window views.
			</para>

				A statement selecting all events from a named window 'AllOrdersNamedWindow' is shown next. The named window must first be created via the <literal>create window</literal> clause before use.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from AllOrdersNamedWindow]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				The statement as above simply receives the unfiltered insert stream of the named window and reports that stream to its listeners. The <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method returns returns all events in the named window, if any.
			</para>

			<para>
				If your application desires to obtain the events removed from the named window, use the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword as this statement shows:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select rstream * from AllOrdersNamedWindow]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				The next statement derives an average price per symbol from all events posted by a named window: 
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, avg(price) from AllOrdersNamedWindow group by symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				Your application may create a consuming statement such as above on an empty named window, or your application may create the above statement on an already filled named window. The engine provides correct results in either case: 
				At the time of statement creation the Esper engine internally initializes the consuming statement from the current named window, also taking your declared filters into consideration. Thus, your statement deriving data from a named window does not start empty if the named window already holds one or more events. A consuming statement also sees the remove stream of an already populated named window, if any.
			</para>

			<para>
				If you require a subset of the data in the named window, you can specify one or more filter expressions onto the named window as shown here:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select symbol, avg(price) from AllOrdersNamedWindow(sector='energy') group by symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				By adding a filter to the named window, the aggregation and grouping as well as any views that may be declared onto to the named window receive a filtered insert and remove stream. The above statement thus outputs, continuously, the average price per symbol for all orders in the named window that belong to a certain sector.
			</para>

			<para>
				A side note on variables in filters filtering events from named windows: The engine initializes consuming statements at statement creation time and changes aggregation state continuously as events arrive. If the filter criteria contain variables and variable values changes, then the engine does not re-evaluate or re-build aggregation state. In such a case you may want to place variables in the <literal>having</literal> clause which evaluates on already-built aggregation state.
			</para>

			<para>
				The following example further declares a view into the named window. Such a view can be a plug-in view or one of the built-in views, but cannot be a data window view (with the exception of the <literal>std:groupwin</literal> grouped-window view which is allowed).
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from AllOrdersNamedWindow(volume>0, price>0).mycompany:mypluginview()]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				Data window views cannot be used onto named windows since named windows post insert and remove streams for the events entering and leaving the named window, thus the expiry policy and batch behavior are well defined by the data window declared for the named window. For example, the following is not allowed and fails at time of statement creation:

			<para>
				The <literal>on select</literal> clause performs a one-time, non-continuous query on a named window every time a triggering event arrives or a triggering pattern matches. The query can consider all events in the named window, or only events that match certain criteria, or events that correlate with an arriving event or a pattern of arriving events.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The syntax for the <literal>on select</literal> clause is as follows:

[having <emphasis>grouping_search_conditions</emphasis>]
[order by <emphasis>order_by_expression_list</emphasis>]
</synopsis>
				
			<para>
				The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that trigger the query against the named window. It is optionally followed by <emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis> which are filter expressions to apply to arriving events. The optional <literal>as</literal> keyword can be used to assign an stream name. Patterns or named windows can also be specified in the <literal>on</literal> clause, see the samples in <xref linkend="named_delete_pattern"/>.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The <emphasis>insert into</emphasis> clause works as described in <xref linkend="epl-insert-into"/>. The <emphasis>select</emphasis> clause is described in <xref linkend="epl-select-list"/>. For all clauses the semantics are equivalent to a join operation: The properties of the triggering event or events are available in the <literal>select</literal> clause and all other clauses.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>window_name</emphasis> in the <literal>from</literal> clause is the name of the named window to select events from. The <literal>as</literal> keyword is also available to assign a stream name to the named window. The <literal>as</literal> keyword is helpful in conjunction with wildcard in the <literal>select</literal> clause to select named window events via the syntax <literal>select streamname.* </literal>.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The optional <literal>where</literal> clause contains a <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis> that correlates the arriving (triggering) event to the events to be considered from the named window. The <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis> may also simply filter for events in the named window to be considered by the query.
			</para>

				The <literal>group by</literal> clause, the <literal>having</literal> clause and the <literal>order by</literal> clause are all optional and work as described in earlier chapters.

			<para>
				The similarities and differences between an <literal>on select</literal> clause and a regular or outer join are as follows: 
			</para>
		<orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
                    A join is evaluated when any of the streams participating in the join have new events (insert stream) or events leaving data windows (remove stream).  A join is therefore bi-directional or multi-directional. However, the <literal>on select</literal> statement has one triggering event or pattern that causes the query to be evaluated and is thus uni-directional.
                </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The query within the <literal>on select</literal> statement is not continuous: It executes only when a triggering event or pattern occurs. Aggregation and groups are computed anew considering the contents of the named window at the time the triggering event arrives.
                </para>
			</listitem>
		</orderedlist>

			<para>
				The <literal>iterator</literal> of the <literal>EPStatement</literal> object representing the <literal>on select</literal> clause returns the last batch of selected events in response to the last triggering event, or null if the last triggering event did not select any rows.
			</para>

			<para>
				For correlated queries that correlate triggering events with events held by a named window, Esper internally creates efficient indexes to enable high performance querying of events. It analyzes the <literal>where</literal> clause to build one or more indexes for fast lookup in the named window based on the properties of the triggering event.
			</para>

			<para>				
				The next statement demonstrates the concept. Upon arrival of a QueryEvent event the statement selects all events in the 'OrdersNamedWindow' named window:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on QueryEvent select win.* from OrdersNamedWindow as win]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				 The engine executes the query on arrival of a triggering event, in this case a QueryEvent. It posts the query results to any listeners to the statement, in a single invocation, as the new data array. By prefixing the wildcard (*) selector with the stream name, the <literal>select</literal> clause returns only events of the named window and does not also return triggering events.
			 </para>

			<para>
				The <literal>where</literal> clause filters and correlates events in the named window with the triggering event, as shown next: 
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on QueryEvent(volume>0) as query
select query.symbol, query.volume, win.symbol  from OrdersNamedWindow as win
where win.symbol = query.symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				 Upon arrival of a QueryEvent, if that event has a value for the volume property that is greater then zero, the engine executes the query. The query considers all events currently held by the 'OrdersNamedWindow' that match the symbol property value of the triggering QueryEvent event. The engine then posts query results to the statement's listeners.
			 </para>

			<para>
				Aggregation, grouping and ordering of results are possible as this example shows:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on QueryEvent as queryEvent
select symbol, sum(volume) from OrdersNamedWindow as win
group by symbol
having volume > 0
order by symbol]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				 The above statement outputs the total volume per symbol for those groups where the sum of the volume is greater then zero, ordered by symbol ascending. The engine computes and posts the output based on the current contents of the 'OrdersNamedWindow' named window considering all events in the named window, since the query does not have a <literal>where</literal> clause.
			 </para>

			<para>
				 When using wildcard (*) to select from streams in an on-select clause, each stream, that is the the triggering stream and the selected-upon named window, are selected, similar to a join. Therefore your wildcard select
				 returns two columns: the triggering event and the selection result event, for each row.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on QueryEvent as queryEvent
select * from OrdersNamedWindow as win]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				 The query above returns a <literal>queryEvent</literal> column and a <literal>win</literal> column for each event. If only a single stream's event is desired in the result, use <literal>select win.*</literal> instead.
			 </para>

			<para>
				 To trigger an on-select when an update to the selected named window occurs or when the triggering event is the same event that is being inserted into the named window, specify the named window name as the event type.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				The next query fires the select for every change to the named window OrdersNamedWindow:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrdersNamedWindow as trig 
select onw.symbol, sum(onw.volume) 
from OrdersNamedWindow as onw 
where onw.symbol = trig.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Statements that reference the named window receive the new event in the insert stream and the event prior to the update in the remove stream. 
			</para>

			<para>				
				Let's look at a couple of examples. In the simplest form, this statement updates all events in the named window 'AllOrdersNamedWindow' when any 'UpdateOrderEvent' event arrives, setting the price property to zero for all events currently held by the named window:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on UpdateOrderEvent update AllOrdersNamedWindow set price = 0]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				This example adds a <literal>where</literal> clause to the example above. Upon arrival of a triggering 'ZeroVolumeEvent', the statement updates prices on any orders that have a volume of zero or less:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on ZeroVolumeEvent update AllOrdersNamedWindow set price = 0 where volume <= 0]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
				The next example shows a more complete use of the syntax, and correlates the triggering event with events held by the named window:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on NewOrderEvent(volume>0) as myNewOrders
update AllOrdersNamedWindow as myNamedWindow 
set price = myNewOrders.price
where myNamedWindow.symbol = myNewOrders.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
				In the above sample statement, only if a 'NewOrderEvent' event with a volume greater then zero arrives does the statement trigger. Upon triggering, all events in the named window that have the same value for the symbol property as the triggering 'NewOrderEvent' event are then updated (their price property is set to that of the arriving event). The statement also showcases the <literal>as</literal> keyword to assign a name for use in the <literal>where</literal> expression.
			</para>

			<para>				
				For correlated queries (as above) that correlate triggering events with events held by a named window, Esper internally creates efficient indexes to enable high performance update of events.

				Your application can subscribe a listener to your <literal>on update</literal> statements to determine update events. The statement post any events that are updated to all listeners attached to the statement as new data, and the events prior to the update as old data. Upon iteration, the statement provides the last update event, if any.
			</para>

				An <literal>on delete</literal> clause removes events from a named window. The clause can be used to remove all events, or only events that match certain criteria, or events that correlate with an arriving event or a pattern of arriving events.
			</para>

			<para>
				The syntax for the <literal>on delete</literal> clause is as follows: 
			</para>
			<synopsis>on <emphasis>event_type</emphasis>[<emphasis>(filter_criteria)</emphasis>] [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
delete from <emphasis>window_name</emphasis> [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
[where <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis>]</synopsis>
				
			<para>
				The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that trigger removal from the named window. It is optionally followed by <emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis> which are filter expressions to apply to arriving events. The optional <literal>as</literal> keyword can be used to assign a name for use in the <literal>where</literal> clause. Patterns and named windows can also be specified in the <literal>on</literal> clause as described in the next section.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The <emphasis>window_name</emphasis> is the name of the named window to delete events from. The <literal>as</literal> keyword is also available to assign a name to the named window.
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The optional <literal>where</literal> clause contains a <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis> that correlates the arriving (triggering) event to the events to be removed from the named window. The <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis> may also simply filter for events in the named window to be removed from the named window.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>iterator</literal> of the <literal>EPStatement</literal> object representing the <literal>on delete</literal> clause can also be helpful: It returns the last batch of deleted events in response to the last triggering event, in any order, or null if the last triggering event did not remove any rows.
			</para>

			<para>				
				Let's look at a couple of examples. In the simplest form, this statement deletes all events from the named window 'AllOrdersNamedWindow' when any 'FlushOrderEvent' arrives:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on FlushOrderEvent delete from AllOrdersNamedWindow]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
				This example adds a <literal>where</literal> clause to the example above. Upon arrival of a triggering 'ZeroVolumeEvent', the statement removes from the named window any orders that have a volume of zero or less:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on ZeroVolumeEvent delete from AllOrdersNamedWindow where volume <= 0]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
				The next example shows a more complete use of the syntax, and correlates the triggering event with events held by the named window:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on NewOrderEvent(volume>0) as myNewOrders
delete from AllOrdersNamedWindow as myNamedWindow 
where myNamedWindow.symbol = myNewOrders.symbol]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
				In the above sample statement, only if a 'NewOrderEvent' event with a volume greater then zero arrives does the statement trigger. Upon triggering, all events in the named window that have the same value for the symbol property as the triggering 'NewOrderEvent' event are then removed from the named window. The statement also showcases the <literal>as</literal> keyword to assign a name for use in the <literal>where</literal> expression.
			</para>

			<para>				
				For correlated queries (as above) that correlate triggering events with events held by a named window, Esper internally creates efficient indexes to enable high performance removal of events especially from named windows that hold large numbers of events.
			</para>

			<para>
				Your application can subscribe a listener to your <literal>on delete</literal> statements to determine removed events. The statement post any events that are deleted from a named window to all listeners attached to the statement as new data. Upon iteration, the statement provides the last deleted event, if any.

			   <title>Using Patterns in the <literal>On Delete</literal> Clause</title>

				<para>
					By means of patterns the <literal>on delete</literal> clause and <literal>on select</literal> clause (described below) can look for more complex conditions to occur, possibly involving multiple events or the passing of time. The syntax for <literal>on delete</literal> with a pattern expression is show next:
				</para>
				<synopsis>on pattern [<emphasis>pattern_expression</emphasis>] [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
delete from <emphasis>window_name</emphasis> [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
[where <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis>]</synopsis>
					
				<para>
					The <emphasis>pattern_expression</emphasis> is any pattern that matches zero or more arriving events. Tags can be used to name events in the pattern and can occur in the optional <literal>where</literal> clause to correlate to events to be removed from a named window.
				</para>
					
				<para>
					In the next example the triggering pattern fires every 10 seconds. The effect is that every 10 seconds the statement removes from 'MyNamedWindow' all rows:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[on pattern [every timer:interval(10 sec)] delete from MyNamedWindow]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The following example shows the use of tags in a pattern: 
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[on pattern [every ord=OrderEvent(volume>0) or every flush=FlushOrderEvent] 
delete from OrderWindow as win
where ord.id = win.id or flush.id = win.id]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The pattern above looks for OrderEvent events with a volume value greater then zero and tags such events as 'ord'. 
					The pattern also looks for FlushOrderEvent events and tags such events as 'flush'. The <literal>where</literal> clause deletes from the 'OrderWindow' named window any events that match in the value of the 'id' property either of the arriving events.

				The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that trigger the merge. It is optionally followed by <emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis> which are filter expressions to apply to arriving events.

			<para>
			    Following the <literal>where</literal> clause is one or more <literal>when matched</literal> or <literal>when not matched</literal> clauses in any order. Each may have an additional search condition associated.

			    After each <literal>when [not] matched</literal> follow one or more <literal>then</literal> clauses that each contain the action to take: Either an <literal>insert</literal>, <literal>update</literal> or <literal>delete</literal> keyword.

			</para>

			<para>
			    After <literal>insert</literal> follows, optionally, the <literal>into</literal> keyword followed by the stream name or named window to insert-into. If no <literal>into</literal> and stream name is specified, the insert applies to the current named window. It follows an optional list of columns inserted. It follows the required <literal>select</literal> keyword and one or more select clause expressions. The wildcard (<literal>*</literal>) is available in the select clause as well. It follows an optional where-clause that may return Boolean false to indicate that the action should not be applied. 
			</para>

			<para>
			     After <literal>update</literal> follows the <literal>set</literal> keyword and one or more assignment pairs. It follows an optional where-clause that may return Boolean false to indicate that the action should not be applied.

			     After <literal>delete</literal> follows an optional where-clause that may return Boolean false to indicate that the action should not be applied.

			<para>
			  When according to the where-clause <emphasis>criteria_expression</emphasis> the engine finds one or more events in the named window that match the condition, the engine evaluates each <emphasis>when matched</emphasis> clause. If the optional search condition returns true or no search condition was provided the engine performs all of the actions listed after each <literal>then</literal>.
			</para>

			<para>
				The engine executes <literal>when matched</literal> and <literal>when not matched</literal> in the order specified. If the optional search condition returns true or no search condition was specified then the engine takes the associated action (or multiple actions for multiple <literal>then</literal> keywords). When the block of actions completed the engine proceeds to the next matching event, if any. After completing all matching events the engine continues to the next triggering event if any.
			</para>

			<para>
			    In the first example we declare a schema that provides a product id and that holds a total price:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create schema ProductTotalRec as (productId string, totalPrice double)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
			    We create a named window that holds a row for each unique product:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create window ProductWindow.std:unique(productId) as ProductTotalRec]]></programlisting>

			<para>
			    The events for this example are order events that hold an order id, product id, price, quantity and deleted-flag declared by the next schema:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create schema OrderEvent as (orderId string, productId string, price double, 
    quantity int, deletedFlag boolean)]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
				The following EPL statement utilizes <literal>on-merge</literal> to total up the price for each product based on arriving order events:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent oe
  merge ProductWindow pw
  where pw.productId = oe.productId
  when matched
    then update set totalPrice = totalPrice + oe.price
  when not matched 
    then insert select productId, price as totalPrice]]></programlisting>
    
			<para>
			    In the above example, when an order event arrives, the engine looks up in the product named window the matching row or rows for the same product id as the arriving event. In this example the engine always finds no row or one row as the product named window is declared with a unique data window based on product id. 
			    If the engine finds a row in the named window, it performs the update action adding up the price as defined under <literal>when matched</literal>. If the engine does not find a row in the named window it performs the insert action as defined under <literal>when not matched</literal>, inserting a new row.
			</para>
    
			<para>
				The <literal>insert</literal> keyword may be followed by a list of columns as shown in this EPL snippet:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// equivalent to the insert shown in the last 2 lines in above EPL
...when not matched 
    then insert(productId, totalPrice) select productId, price]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				The second example demonstrates the use of a select-clause with wildcard, a search condition and the <literal>delete</literal> keyword. It creates a named window that holds order events and employs on-merge to insert order events for which no corresponding order id was found, update quantity to the quantity provided by the last arriving event and delete order events that are marked as deleted:
			</para>
			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create window OrderWindow.win:keepall() as OrderEvent]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent oe
  merge OrderWindow pw
  where pw.orderId = oe.orderId
  when not matched 
    then insert select *
  when matched and oe.deletedFlag=true
    then delete
  when matched
    then update set pw.quantity = oe.quantity, pw.price = oe.price]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				In the above example the <literal>oe.deletedFlag=true</literal> search condition instructs the engine to take the delete action only if the deleted-flag is set.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				You may specify multiple actions by providing multiple <literal>then</literal> keywords each followed by an action. Each of the <literal>insert</literal>, <literal>update</literal> and <literal>delete</literal> actions can itself have a where-clause as well.
				If a where-clause exists for an action, the engine evaluates the where-clause and applies the action only if the where-clause returns Boolean true.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				This example specifies two update actions and uses the where-clause to trigger different update behavior depending on whether the order event price is less then zero:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent oe
  merge OrderWindow pw
  where pw.orderId = oe.orderId
  when matched
    then update set pw.quantity = 0, pw.price = 0 where oe.price < 0
    then update set pw.quantity = oe.quantity, pw.price = oe.price where oe.price >= 0]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				To insert events into another stream and not the named window, use <literal>insert</literal> <literal>into</literal> <emphasis>streamname</emphasis>.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				In the next example each matched-clause contains two actions, one action to insert a log event and a second action to insert, delete or update:
			</para>
			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent oe
  merge OrderWindow pw
  where pw.orderId = oe.orderId
  when not matched 
    then insert into LogEvent select 'this is an insert' as name
    then insert select *
  when matched and oe.deletedFlag=true
    then insert into LogEvent select 'this is a delete' as name
    then delete
  when matched
    then insert into LogEvent select 'this is a update' as name
    then update set pw.quantity = oe.quantity, pw.price = oe.price]]></programlisting>
    
			<para>
				While the engine evaluates and executes all actions listed under the same matched-clause in order, you may not rely on updated field values of an earlier action to trigger the where-clause of a later action. Similarly you should avoid simultaneous update and delete actions for the same match: the engine does not guarantee whether the update or the delete take final affect.
			</para>
			
			<para>				
				For correlated queries (as above) that correlate triggering events with events held by a named window, Esper internally creates efficient indexes to enable high performance update and removal of events especially from named windows that hold large numbers of events.
			</para>

			<para>
				Your application can subscribe a listener to <literal>on merge</literal> statements to determine inserted, updated and removed events. Statements post any events that are inserted to, updated or deleted from a named window to all listeners attached to the statement as new data and removed data. Upon iteration, the statement provides the last inserted events, if any.

			</para>

			<para>
				You do not need to explicitly create an index unless using on-demand (fire-and-forget) queries. Therefore you do not need to explicitly create an index for <literal>on-select</literal>, <literal>on-merge</literal>, <literal>on-update</literal>, <literal>on-delete</literal> as well as subqueries or consuming statements against named windows.
				However if the engine finds an explicitly-created index matching the requirements of such on-query or subqueries it uses that index instead.
			</para>

			<para>
				Please use the following syntax to create an explicit index on a named window:
			</para>
			<synopsis>create index <emphasis>index_name</emphasis> on <emphasis>named_window_name</emphasis> (<emphasis>property</emphasis> [hash|btree] 
    [, property] [hash|btree] [,...] )</synopsis>
			
			<para>
				The <emphasis>index_name</emphasis> is the name assigned to the index. The name uniquely identifies the index and is used in engine logging.
			</para>

			<para>
				The <emphasis>named_window_name</emphasis> is the name of an existing named window. If the named window has data already, the engine builds an index for the data in the named window.
			</para>

			<para>
				The list of <emphasis>property</emphasis> names are the properties of events within the named window to include in the index. Following each property name you may specify the optional <literal>hash</literal> or <literal>btree</literal> keyword.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				If you specify no keyword or the <literal>hash</literal> keyword for a property, the index will be a hash-based (unsorted) index in respect to that property. If you specify the <literal>btree</literal> keyword, the index will be a binary-tree-based sorted index in respect to that property.
				You may combine <literal>hash</literal> and <literal>btree</literal> properties for the same index.
				Specify <literal>btree</literal> for a property if you expect to perform numerical or string comparison using relational operators (&lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=), the <literal>between</literal> or the <literal>in</literal> keyword for ranges and inverted ranges.
			</para>

			<para>
				We list a few example EPL statements next that create a named window and create a single index:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// create a named window
create window UserProfileWindow.win:time(1 hour) select * from UserProfile]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[// create an index for the user id property only
create index UserProfileIndex on UserProfileWindow(userId)]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Next, execute an on-demand fire-and-forget query as shown below, herein we use the prepared version to demonstrate:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[String query = "select * from UserProfileWindow where userId='Joe'";
EPOnDemandPreparedQuery prepared = epRuntime.prepareQuery(query);
// query performance excellent in the face of large number of rows
EPOnDemandQueryResult result = prepared.execute();
// ...later ...
prepared.execute();	// execute a second time]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				By default, the engine builds a hash code -based index useful for direct comparison via equals (=). Filter expressions that look for ranges or use <literal>in, between </literal> do not benefit from the hash-based index and should use the <literal>btree</literal> keyword.
			</para>			
			<para>

			<title>Versioning and Revision Event Type Use with Named Windows</title>
			
			<indexterm><primary>named window</primary><secondary>versioning events</secondary></indexterm>

			<para>
				As outlined in <xref linkend="eventrep-update"/>, revision event types process updates or new versions of events held by a named window.
			</para>

			<para>
			    A revision event type is simply one or more existing pre-configured event types whose events are related, as configured by static configuration, by event properties that provide same key values. The purpose of key values is to 
			    indicate that arriving events are related: An event amends, updates or adds properties to an earlier event that shares the same key values. No additional EPL is needed when using revision event types for merging event data.
			</para>

			<para>
			    Revision event types can be useful in these situations:
			</para>
			<orderedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Some of your events carry only partial information that is related to a prior event and must be merged together.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Events arrive that add additional properties or change existing properties of prior events.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Events may carry properties that have null values or properties that do no exist (for example events backed by Map or XML), and for such properties the earlier value must be used instead.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>

			<para>
			    To better illustrate, consider a revision event type that represents events for creation and updates to user profiles. Lets assume the user profile creation events carry the user id and a full profile. The profile update events indicate only the user id and the individual properties that actually changed. The user id property shall serve as a key value relating profile creation events and update events.
			</para>

			<para>
			    A revision event type must be configured to instruct the engine which event types participate and what their key properties are. Configuration is described in <xref linkend="config-revisionevent"/> and is not shown here.
			</para>
			
			<para>				
				Assume that an event type <literal>UserProfileRevisions</literal> has been configured to hold profile events, i.e. creation and update events related by user id. This statement creates a named window to hold the last 1 hour of current profiles per user id:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[create window UserProfileWindow.win:time(1 hour) select * from UserProfileRevisions]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into UserProfileWindow select * from UserProfileCreation]]></programlisting>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into UserProfileWindow select * from UserProfileUpdate]]></programlisting>

			<para>				
			    In revision event types, the term <emphasis>base</emphasis> event is used to describe events that are subject to update. Events that update, amend or add additional properties to base events are termed <emphasis>delta</emphasis> events. 
			    In the example, base events are profile creation events and delta events are profile update events. 
			</para>

			<para>				
			    Base events are expected to arrive before delta events. In the case where a delta event arrives and is not related by key value to a base event or a revision of the base event currently held by the named window the engine ignores the delta event. Thus, considering the example, profile update events for a user id that does not have an existing profile in the named window are not applied.
			</para>

			<para>
			    When a base or delta event arrives, the insert and remove stream output by the named window are the current and the prior version of the event. Let's come back to the example. As creation events arrive that are followed by update events or more creation events for the same user id, the engine posts the current version of the profile as insert stream (new data) and the prior version of the profile as remove stream (old data).
			</para>

			<para>				
			    Base events are also implicitly delta events. That is, if multiple base events of the same key property values arrive, then each base event provides a new version. In the example, if multiple profile creation events arrive for the same user id then new versions of the current profile for that user id are output by the engine for each base event, as it does for delta events.
			</para>

			<para>				
			    The expiry policy as specified by view definitions applies to each distinct key value, or multiple distinct key values for composite keys. An expiry policy re-evaluates when new versions arrive. In the example, user profile events expire from the time window when no creation or update event for a given user id has been received for 1 hour.
			</para>

			<para>				
			    Several strategies are available for merging or overlaying events as the configuration chapter describes in greater detail.
			</para>

			<para>				
			    Any of the Map, XML and native event representations as well as plug-in event representations may participate in a revision event type. For example, profile creation events could be native events, while profile update events could be <literal>System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary</literal> events.
			</para>

			<para>				
			    Delta events may also add properties to the revision event type. For example, one could add a new event type with security information to the revision event type and such security-related properties become available on the resulting revision event type.
			</para>

			<para>
				The following restrictions apply to revision event types:
			</para>        
			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Nested properties are only supported for the native event representation. Nested properties are not individually versioned; they are instead versioned by the containing property.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Dynamic, indexed and mapped properties are only supported for nested properties and not as properties of the revision event type itself.
					</para>

			EPL allows declaring an event type via the <literal>create schema</literal> clause and also by means of the static or runtime configuration API <literal>AddEventType</literal> functions. The term schema and event type has the same meaning in EPL.
		</para>

		<para>
			Your application can declare an event type by providing the property names and types or by providing a class name. Your application may also declare a variant stream schema.
		</para>

		<para>
			When using the <literal>create schema</literal> syntax to declare an event type, the engine automatically removes the event type when there are no started statements referencing the event type, including the statement that declared the event type. When using
			the configuration API, the event type stays cached even if there are no statements that refer to the event type and until explicitly removed via the runtime configuration API.

		<title>Splitting and Duplicating Streams</title>
		
		<para>
			EPL offers a convenient syntax to splitting and duplicating events into multiple streams, and for receiving unmatched events among a set of filter criteria.
		</para>

		<para>
			You may define a triggering event or pattern in the <literal>on</literal>-part of the statement followed by multiple <literal>insert into</literal>, <literal>select</literal> and <literal>where</literal> clauses.
		</para>

		<para>
			The synopsis is:
		</para>

<synopsis>on <emphasis>event_type</emphasis>[(<emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis>)] [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
insert into <emphasis>insert_into_def</emphasis> select <emphasis>select_list</emphasis> [where <emphasis>condition</emphasis>]
[insert into <emphasis>insert_into_def</emphasis> select <emphasis>select_list</emphasis> [where <emphasis>condition</emphasis>]]
[insert into...]
[output first | all]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that trigger the split stream. It is optionally
followed by <emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis> which are filter expressions to apply to arriving events. The optional <literal>as</literal> keyword
can be used to assign a stream name. Patterns and named windows can also be specified in the <literal>on</literal> clause.
		</para>

		<para>
			Following the <literal>on</literal>-clause is one or more <emphasis>insert into</emphasis> clauses as described in <xref linkend="epl-insert-into"/> and <emphasis>select</emphasis> clauses as described in <xref linkend="epl-select-list"/>. 
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Each <literal>select</literal> clause may be followed by a <literal>where</literal> clause containing a condition. If the condition is true for the event, the engine transforms the event according to the <literal>select</literal> clause and inserts it into the corresponding stream.
		</para>

		<para>
			At the end of the statement can be an optional <literal>output</literal> clause. By default the engine inserts into the first stream for which the <literal>where</literal> clause condition matches if one was specified, starting from the top. If you specify the <literal>output all</literal> keywords, then the engine inserts into each stream (not only the first stream) for which the <literal>where</literal> clause condition matches or that do not have a <literal>where</literal> clause.
		</para>

		<para>
			If, for a given event, none of the <literal>where</literal> clause conditions match, the statement listener receives the unmatched event. The statement listener only receives unmatched events and does not receive any transformed or inserted events. The <literal>GetEnumerator</literal> method to the statement returns no events.
		</para>

		<para>
			In the below sample statement, the engine inserts each <literal>OrderEvent</literal> into the <literal>LargeOrders</literal> stream if the order quantity is 100 or larger, or into the <literal>SmallOrders</literal> stream if the order quantity is smaller then 100:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent 
  insert into LargeOrders select * where orderQty >= 100
  insert into SmallOrders select *]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The next example statement adds a new stream for medium-sized orders. The new stream receives orders that have an order quantity between 20 and 100:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent 
  insert into LargeOrders select orderId, customer where orderQty >= 100
  insert into MediumOrders select orderId, customer where orderQty between 20 and 100
  insert into SmallOrders select orderId, customer where orderQty > 0]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			As you may have noticed in the above statement, orders that have an order quantity of zero don't match any of the conditions. The engine does not insert such order events into any stream and the listener to the statement receives these unmatched events.
		</para>

		<para>
			By default the engine inserts into the first <literal>insert into</literal> stream without a <literal>where</literal> clause or for which the <literal>where</literal> clause condition matches. To change the default behavior and insert into all matching streams instead (including those without a <literal>where</literal> clause), the <literal>output all</literal> keywords may be added to the statement.
		</para>

		<para>
			The sample statement below shows the use of the <literal>output all</literal> keywords. The statement populates both the <literal>LargeOrders</literal> stream with large orders as well as the <literal>VIPCustomerOrders</literal> stream with orders for certain customers based on customer id:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[on OrderEvent 
  insert into LargeOrders select * where orderQty >= 100
  insert into VIPCustomerOrders select * where customerId in (1001, 1002)
  output all]]></programlisting>
  
	  <para>
		  Since the <literal>output all</literal> keywords are present, the above statement inserts each order event into either both streams or only one stream or none of the streams, depending on order quantity and customer id of the order event. The statement delivers order events not inserted into any of the streams to the listeners and/or subscriber to the statement.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		  The following limitations apply to split-stream statements:

				Variables are optimized towards high read frequency and lower write frequency. Variable reads do not incur locking overhead (99% of the time) while variable writes do incur locking overhead. 
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The engine softly guarantees consistency and atomicity of variables when your statement executes in response to an event or timer invocation. Variables acquire a stable value (implemented by versioning) when your statement starts executing in response to an event or timer invocation, and variables do not change value during execution. When one or more variable values are updated via <literal>on set</literal> statements, the changes to all updated variables become visible to statements as one unit and only when the <literal>on set</literal> statement completes successfully.

				The atomicity and consistency guarantee is a soft guarantee. If any of your application statements, in response to an event or timer invocation, execute for a time interval longer then 15 seconds (default interval length), then the engine may use current variable values after 15 seconds passed, rather then then-current variable values at the time the statement started executing in response to an event or timer invocation.

	   <title>Updating an Insert Stream: the Update IStream Clause</title>
	   
		<para>
			The <literal>update istream</literal> statement allows declarative modification of event properties of events entering a stream. Update is a pre-processing step to each new event, modifying an event before the event applies to any statements.
		</para>

		<para>
			The synopsis of <literal>update istream</literal> is as follows:
		</para>

		<synopsis>update istream <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> [as <emphasis>stream_name</emphasis>]
  set <emphasis>property_name</emphasis> = <emphasis>set_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>property_name</emphasis> = <emphasis>set_expression</emphasis>] [,...]
  [where <emphasis>where_expression</emphasis>]
</synopsis>

		<para>
			The <emphasis>event_type</emphasis> is the name of the type of events that the <literal>update</literal> applies to.
			The optional <literal>as</literal> keyword can be used to assign a name to the event type for use with subqueries, for example.
			Following the <literal>set</literal> keyword is a comma-separated list of property names and expressions that provide the event properties to change and values to set.
		</para>

		<para>
			The optional <literal>where</literal> clause and expression can be used to filter out events to which to apply updates.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Listeners to an <literal>update</literal> statement receive the updated event in the insert stream (new data) and the event prior to the update in the remove stream (old data). Note that if there are multiple update statements that all apply to the same event then the engine will ensure that the output events delivered to listeners or subscribers are consistent with the then-current updated properties of the event (if necessary making event copies, as described below, in the case that listeners are attached to update statements). Iterating over an update statement returns no events.
		</para>

		<para>
			As an example, the below statement assumes an <literal>AlertEvent</literal> event type that has properties named <literal>severity</literal> and <literal>reason</literal>:
		</para>
		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[update istream AlertEvent 
  set severity = 'High'
  where severity = 'Medium' and reason like '%withdrawal limit%']]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The statement above changes the value of the <literal>severity</literal> property to "High" for <literal>AlertEvent</literal> events that have a medium severity and contain a specific reason text.
		</para>

		<para>
			Update statements apply the changes to event properties before other statements receive the event(s) for processing, e.g. "<literal>select * from AlertEvent</literal>" receives the updated <literal>AlertEvent</literal>. This is true regardless of the order in which your application creates statements.
		</para>

		<para>
			When multiple update statements apply to the same event, the engine executes updates in the order in which update statements are created. We recommend the <literal>@Priority</literal> EPL annotation to define a deterministic order of processing updates, especially in the case where update statements get created and destroyed dynamically or multiple update statements update the same fields. The update statement with the highest <literal>@Priority</literal> value applies last.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>update</literal> clause can be used on streams populated via <literal>insert into</literal>, as this example utilizing a pattern demonstrates:
		</para>		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into DoubleWithdrawalStream 
select a.id, b.id, a.account as account, 0 as minimum 
from pattern [a=Withdrawal -> b=Withdrawal(id = a.id)]]]></programlisting>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[update istream DoubleWithdrawalStream set minimum = 1000 where account in (10002, 10003)]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			When using <literal>update</literal> with named windows, any changes to event properties apply before an event enters the named window.
		</para>

		<para>
			Consider the next example (shown here with statement names in @Name EPL annotation, multiple EPL statements):
		</para>		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[@Name("CreateWindow") create window MyWindow.win:time(30 sec) as AlertEvent

@Name("UpdateStream") update istream MyWindow set severity = 'Low' where reason = '%out of paper%'

@Name("InsertWindow") insert into MyWindow select * from AlertEvent

@Name("SelectWindow") select * from MyWindow]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The <literal>UpdateStream</literal> statement specifies an <literal>update</literal> clause that applies to all events entering the named window. Note that <literal>update</literal> does not apply to events already in the named window at the time an application creates the <literal>UpdateStream</literal> statement, it only applies to new events entering the named window (after an application created the <literal>update</literal> statement).
		</para>

		<para>
			Therefore, in the above example listeners to the <literal>SelectWindow</literal> statement as well as the <literal>CreateWindow</literal> statement receive the updated event, 
			while listeners to the <literal>InsertWindow</literal> statement receive the original <literal>AlertEvent</literal> event (and not the updated event).
		</para>

		<para>
			Subqueries can also be used in all expressions including the optional <literal>where</literal> clause.
		</para>		

		<para>
			This example demonstrates a correlated subquery in an assignment expression and also demonstrates the optional <literal>as</literal> keyword. It assigns the <literal>phone</literal> property of an <literal>AlertEvent</literal> event a new value based on the lookup within all unique <literal>PhoneEvent</literal> events (according to an <literal>empid</literal> property) correlating the <literal>AlertEvent</literal> property <literal>reporter</literal> with the <literal>empid</literal> property of <literal>PhoneEvent</literal>:
		</para>		
		<programlisting><![CDATA[update istream AlertEvent as ae
  set phone = 
    (select phone from PhoneEvent.std:unique(empid) where empid = ae.reporter)]]></programlisting>

		<sect2 id="epl-update-object" revision="1">
			<title>Immutability and Updates</title>
	
			<para>
				When updating event objects the engine maintains consistency across statements. The engine ensures that an update to an event does not impact the results of statements that look for or retain the original un-updated event. 
				As a result the engine may need to copy an event object to maintain consistency.
			</para>

			<para>
				In the case your application utilizes objects as the underlying event representation and an <literal>update</literal> statement updates properties on an object, then in order to maintain consistency across statements 
				it is necessary for the engine to copy the object before changing properties (and thus not change the original object). 
			</para>

			<para>
				For application objects, the copy operation is implemented by serialization. Your event object must therefore implement the <literal>Serializable</literal> behavior to become eligible for update. As an alternative to serialization, you may instead configure a copy method as part of the event type configuration via <literal>ConfigurationEventTypeLegacy</literal>.

	<sect1 id="epl-grouped-delivery" revision="1">
		<title>Controlling Event Delivery : The <literal>For</literal> Clause</title>
		
		<para>
			The engine delivers all result events of a given statement to the statement's listeners and subscriber (if any) in a single invocation of each listener and subscriber's <literal>Update</literal> method passing an array of result events. For example, a statement using a time-batch view may provide many result events after a time period passes, a pattern may provide multiple matching events or in a join the join cardinality could be multiple rows.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			For statements that typically post multiple result events to listeners the <literal>for</literal> keyword controls the number of invocations of the engine to listeners and subscribers and the subset of all result events delivered by each invocation. 
			This can be useful when your application listener or subscriber code expects multiple invocations or expects that invocations only receive events that belong together by some additional criteria.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>for</literal> keyword is a reserved keyword. It is followed by either the <literal>grouped_delivery</literal> keyword for grouped delivery or the <literal>discrete_delivery</literal> keyword for discrete delivery. The <literal>for</literal> clause is valid after any EPL select statement.

			The synopsis for grouped delivery is as follows:

		<synopsis>... for grouped_delivery (<emphasis>group_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>group_expression</emphasis>] [,...])</synopsis>
		
		<para>
			The <emphasis>group_expression</emphasis> expression list provides one or more expressions to apply to result events. The engine invokes listeners and subscribers once for each distinct set of values returned by <emphasis>group_expression</emphasis> expressions passing only the events for that group.
		</para>

		<para>
			The synopsis for discrete delivery is as follows:
		</para>
		<synopsis>... for discrete_delivery</synopsis>

		<para>
			With discrete delivery the engine invokes listeners and subscribers once for each result event passing a single result event in each invocation.
